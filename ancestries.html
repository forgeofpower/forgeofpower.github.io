<h3 id="awakened">
    Awakened
</h3>









<p>Awakened are normal animals that were granted incredible intelligence through magic. The <a href="druid.html#awaken">Awaken</a> spell was invented by a well-meaning druid who sought to equalize animals and humanoids. However, the spell worked too well: the awakened animals were even more intelligent than humanoids! The confused and fearful humanoids pushed the awakened away, and most awakened retreated to live solitary lives in their home forests. The Awaken spell was passed down through the generations, so that new animals are slowly being awakened even today.</p>

<h3 id="physical-description">Physical Description</h3>

<p>Awakened appear almost completely like their original animal forms. The main physical difference between awakened animals and their natural relatives is that awakened animals have opposable thumbs that let them use tools as well as humanoids. Awakened have very sophistical brains compared to normal humanoids. Some awakened can instantly solve complex math puzzles, build incredible technological gadgets, or even channel innate psionic powers. Any type of animal can be awakened: bears, gorillas, raccoons, velociraptors, and cats are common.</p>

<h3 id="awakened-in-society">Awakened in Society</h3>

<p>Most awakened live separately from humanoid society. Awakened rarely build settlements, preferring a natural lifestyle in tune with nature. Awakened sometimes live alongside non-awakened animals, which they might see as relatives who haven’t yet been given the gift of intelligence. The awakened are loosely governed by the druidic conclaves that spread knowledge of the Awaken spell. These druidic conclaves awaken new animals as fast as they can, but the complex Awaken spell can only be cast by the most powerful druids, which greatly limits the rate of growth of the awakened population.</p>

<h3 id="dwarf">
    Dwarf
</h3>









<p>Dwarves are short and hardy humanoids with a reputation as determined and skilled workers. While they originally came from massive underground fortresses in the mountains, most dwarves now live in urban areas alongside members of all races.</p>

<h3 id="physical-description">Physical Description</h3>

<p>Dwarves are shorter than humans, and usually stand around 4 feet tall. Dwarves are stouter and denser than their frames might suggest, so they weigh about the same as humans and have similar physical strength. Male and female dwarves have similar builds, with no significant gender difference in weight or height. Dwarves live about twice as long as humans, usually 120-150 years. They have the typical range of skin and hair colors, though both male and female dwarves grow long facial hair. Most dwarves braid their beards into long, intricate patterns, often incorporating metal jewlery or rings.</p>

<h3 id="dwarves-in-society">Dwarves in Society</h3>

<p>Dwarves have a reputation as skilled workers, especially in mining, smithing, constructing, cooking, and jewelry. In most cities, the best and most experienced crafters around will all be dwarves. This might come from their cultural work ethic, or perhaps their longer lifespan means they can spend more time perfecting their skills. Every town and city need as many skilled crafters, workers, and merchants as possible, so dwarves are welcomed with open arms in most areas.</p>

<p>Many dwarves live in tight-knit clans. Dwarves in the same clan protect and support one another. Adult dwarves teach the children of their clan, passing on their professional skills to the next generation. Most marriages are between dwarves of the same clan, so two dwarves in the same clan are more likely than not related to one another through some distant chain of ancestors. Dwarven clans often construct new neighborhoods to live in, so many large cities will have dwarven quarters with amazing architecture and a large population of dwarves.</p>

<h3 id="elf">
    Elf
</h3>









<p>Elves are long-lived humanoids who are known for their grace, elegance, and culture. An elf can master many subjects over the centuries, but the years often leave them with strange eccentricities. Elves tend to develop psionic powers over the years, so the oldest elves are strange, eldritch sages with versatile knowledge and abilities.</p>

<h3 id="physical-description">Physical Description</h3>

<p>Elves are the same height as humans on average. Elves are slimmer than humans, giving them superhuman grace but lower strength. They have long and sharply-pointed ears, and they have similarly sharp and angled facial features. Elves have the same range of skin, hair, and eye colors as humans. Elves of both genders tend to wear their hair long instead of cutting it short. Elves mature many times slower than humans, reaching adulthood at around 50 years old. Elves never age past their physical prime, and they never die of old age.</p>

<h3 id="elves-in-society">Elves in Society</h3>

<p>Elves are often envied by humans for their lifespan. At a glance, it’s impossible to tell if an elf is 60 years old or a thousand. Even after elves stop aging physically, they continue to age mentally. Younger elves tend to be reckless and confident, while older elves tend to be eccentric and conceited. This mental age often brings the gift of psychic powers, which are more common among elves than any other ancestry. However, as the countless years take their toll, the oldest elves slip towards erratic behavior or outright insanity.</p>

<p>Most elves live in small, insular communities with like-minded elves. These communities are led by the oldest elves, who are both the most eccentric and the most set in their ways. Some leaders drive their communities to extreme behaviors: some repress all of their emotions, only talk telepathically, or treat trees as people. Many young elves move to human cities to escape their birth communities, rejecting the oppressive elders and their extreme way of life.</p>

<h3 id="goblin">
    Goblin
</h3>









<p>Goblins are short, green-skinned humanoids who stand roughly 3 feet tall. While they appear vaguely similar to humans, goblins are actually a type of fungus. Their green skin comes from chlorophyll, they have no biological genders, they reproduce asexually by spreading spores, they are vulnerable to fire, and they can draw some energy from sunlight.</p>

<h3 id="physical-description">Physical Description</h3>

<p>Goblins have oversized heads and misshapen, bulbous torsos. They have very sharp teeth than can chew through almost any material, and tough stomachs that can digest even more. Goblins mutate significantly between generations, so each goblin looks different than its parent. These mutations often manifest as deformed facial features or strange lumps. Most goblins live for a very short time, only 5-30 years.</p>

<p>Goblins follow a radically different lifecycle than normal species. An adult goblin’s body contains thousands of spores, which they can plant one at a time, or that release all at once upon death. Spores can float on the wind or be carried by unwitting animals for months. Any spore that reaches a suitable environment (low light, rich soil, some water, and geothermal energy) will start to grow. A young goblin that emerges from a spore carries some instinctual memories from its parent and grows to physical adulthood after only a year.</p>

<h3 id="goblins-in-society">Goblins in Society</h3>

<p>Most goblins live apart from human society, as their biology gives them a very different set of needs and goals. Goblins are less concerned with social status and wealth than humans, as they aren’t driven to marry or provide for children in the same way. It is rare to see a goblin work to cultivate a positive reputation or try to amass material wealth. On the other hand, goblins care much more about creating or protecting the spaces where their spores can grow. Most goblins live in or near these spaces: city sewers, underground cave structures, or dense forest floors.</p>

<p>Very few non-goblins are aware than goblins are fungi instead of mammals. This misunderstanding has led to discrimination, as some humanoids see goblins as uncivilized, insane, or deformed. This prejudice makes it hard for goblins to succeed as part of human society. Some goblins try anyways, as they work to ensure government and economic institutions respect goblins’ unique needs. These reformers are slowly reducing personal and systemic racism against goblins.</p>

<h3 id="kami">
    Kami
</h3>









<p>Kami are divine spirits, the natural rulers of the world. While all kami are gods, some are more powerful than others. The major kami have the power to create and destroy planets, and are worshipped by millions of humanoids around the world. The minor kami described here are mere functionaries or bureaucrats in the celestial bureaucracy, the spirit government that oversees the entire world. Most kami live in Heaven, a giant palace in the spirit world that acts as the seat of the celestial bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Each kami holds a specific role in the celestial bureaucracy, called their domain. A major kami might be in charge of all storms and weather, while a minor kami serving them might be in charge of just lightning strikes. A kami’s office in Heaven gives them near-total control over their domain: the minor kami of lightning can send bolts of lightning from anywhere they want from inside of a storm cloud. Outside of their office, a kami has little more divine power than anyone else.</p>

<h3 id="physical-description">Physical Description</h3>

<p>Kami are spirits. Like all spirits, they don’t age or reproduce. Unlike the wild fey spirits, kami have static humanoid forms. The only thing that distinguishes a kami from a normal human/elf/dwarf/etc. are minor physical features inspired by their domain. A kami of lightning might have sparkling yellow eyes and constantly generate static electricity, while a kami of a water might have blue hair and an exceptional ability to swim.</p>

<h3 id="kami-in-society">Kami in Society</h3>

<p>Kami are all organized into a strict hierarchy in the celestial bureaucracy. Each kami has a direct superior, who has another direct superior, which extends in a long bureaucratic chain. At the top are the Secretary of Creation (who commands the entire world), and even above them, the Jade Emperor (who rules all of existence). Kami are obligated to follow all orders given by their superiors. This is merely one rule of the massive divine legal code of Natural Law. A kami who disobeys Natural Law will attract the attention of the dreaded <em>higher-ups</em>. Major legal violates will cause a kami to be excommunicated from the celestial bureaucracy. An excommunicated kami is analogous to a fallen angel in Christian mythology. They are viewed as evil, heretical, and flawed, and they are totally unwelcome in Heaven.</p>

<p>While most kami live in Heaven, the more adventurous kami might travel to or live in the material world. Since all popular religions worship major kami, a minor kami in the material world might act as an emissary or priest of their a religion. Humanoids generally treat kami with reverence, especially kami who serve a major kami they worship. However, proving you’re a kami can be difficult, as kami are physically identical to humanoids.</p>

<h3 id="lizardfolk">
    Lizardfolk
</h3>









<p>Lizardfolk are scaled, reptilian humanoids who can mutate to copy the traits of animals they eat. Normal lizardfolk have minor adaptations that make them strong, fast, and adaptable. The oldest and strongest lizardfolk have mutated to become giant monsters with awesome size and power. Stories of dragons, basilisks, dinosaurs, and the like are usually about powerful lizardfolk.</p>

<h3 id="physical-description">Physical Description</h3>

<p>Lizardfolk are slightly larger than humans, usually standing around 6 feet tall and weighing 150-200 pounds. Lizardfolk are covered in colorful scales, usually green or sometimes blue, grey, or brown. Lizardfolk have softer and paler scales along their chest and stomach, and a ridge of tougher spiky scales down their back. Some lizardfolk (most commonly male lizardfolk) have a large crest along the back of their head and neck, which changes in color as they mutate. All lizardfolk have large and strong tails, which act like a third leg and help them balance.</p>

<h3 id="society">Society</h3>

<p>Lizardfolk usually live in rural communities near swamps, coastlines, or rivers. Most prefer living near nature instead of behind high walls. While wandering monsters pose a severe danger, those same monsters give lizardfolk the chance to mutate. In cities, lizardfolk prefer to live near rivers and lakes, where they can swim around and hunt fish. Lizardfolk are sometimes seen as exotic by more insular humans or elves, but in general they’re common and well-accepted in cities. Large mutated lizardfolk are rare, but when seen, they can alarm people who are frightened of dragons or other monsters.</p>

<h3 id="outsider">
    Outsider
</h3>









<p>Outsiders are eldritch spirits that feed off of the emotions of humanoids. Each individual outsider feeds on a different emotion. Outsiders are categorized as angels or devils depending on the emotion they absorb: angels eat positive emotions, while devils eat negative emotions. An angel might feed off of <em>Satisfaction</em> or <em>Amusement</em>, while a devil might feed off of <em>Shame</em> or <em>Disappointment</em>.</p>

<h3 id="physical-description">Physical Description</h3>

<p>Outsiders are spirits. Like all spirits, they don’t age or reproduce. Outsiders’ physical bodies are magical constructs made of stone, clay, or similar materials. Over time, an outsider can reshape their body to appear as any form they choose. Most outsiders choose normal humanoid forms in order to blend in to society. When an outsider is hurt, their body starts to disintegrate, as chunks of material fall off of their form.</p>

<p>Instead of eating and drinking, outsiders power their bodies by absorbing emotions from nearby humanoids. This absorption affects all humanoids within a few hundred feet. This slightly dampens the emotions of the affected humanoids, but the effect is usually too subtle to notice. An outsider who lives in a town or city can easily survive off the emotions of the other inhabitants.</p>

<h3 id="outsiders-in-society">Outsiders in Society</h3>

<p>Outsiders almost always live in towns and cities alongside members of other races. Outsiders never live completely apart from others, as isolation means starvation. Most outsiders have specific emotions that they prefer to eat above all others, in the same way most humans prefer sweet cake to stale bread. For example, an angel who eats <em>Satisfaction</em> might prefer <em>The Satisfaction of Eating a Good Pastry</em>, or a devil who eats <em>Shame</em> might prefer <em>The Shame of Having an Embarassing Secret Exposed</em>. To get a quality meal, outsiders often try to inspire these specific emotions in nearby humanoids. This can make outsiders come across as manipulative or creepy to members of other races.</p>

<p>Other races are usually not fond of outsiders. This stems from outsiders’ tendency towards emotional manipulation - it’s hard to feel comfortable when your neighbor is constantly trying to mess with your emotions. This has led to false depictions of outsiders as murderous shapeshifters and malevolent villains. All major religions condemn outsiders as spiritual abberations, as the kami claim that outsiders violate the normal cycle of life and death. Most outsiders choose to hide from this racism, pretending to be normal humanoids.</p>

<h3 id="undead">
    Undead
</h3>









<p>Undead are the partially reanimated bodies or souls of dead creatures. An undead is created when a dead soul is stuck in the material world because of necromantic magic or strong lingering attachments. If only a small part of the soul is still attached to the world, this creates a lesser undead, a mindless corpse powered by a tiny soul fragment. (Lesser undead only know how to destroy and consume, and are not an option for player characters.) However, if the soul manages to stay in the world entirely, it becomes a greater undead, a fully sentient creature animated by the conviction of the dead soul.</p>

<h3 id="physical-description">Physical Description</h3>

<p>Undead are animated humanoid corpses. Their bodies are partially rotting and decayed, but are also preserved through magic. The stronger an undead’s attachment to the material world, the stronger this preserving magic, and the healthier their bodies appear. A determined and willful undead might appear indistinguishable from a living humanoid of their race. An older, less attached, or mentally unstable undead would appear extremely decayed or even completely skeletal. Less stable undead may have glowing red eyes, exude an aura of darkness, or be partially ethereal.</p>

<h3 id="undead-in-society">Undead in Society</h3>

<p>Lesser undead are a constant menace to society. They form naturally and easily, as many souls die with moderate lingering attachments to the material world. Any time a person dies, there’s a risk of a murderous undead rising from their grave. Thankfully, <a href="healer.html#ceremony">Ceremony</a> spells are common and can easily prevent undead from rising. In most humanoid cultures, priests are responsible for burying all citizens and fighting off the menace of undeath.</p>

<p>Greater undead are very different from lesser undead, but that doesn’t stop some people from conflating the two. Some ignorant humanoids tar all undead with the same brush, labeling greater undead murderers and threats to society. The loudest of these people are often the priests and kami who fight the threat of lesser undead every day. Racist discrimination propagated by organized religion is a fact of life for many undead. Some undead avoid this discrimination by hiding their race, pretending to be humanoids, while others work to prove the stereotypes wrong.</p>
