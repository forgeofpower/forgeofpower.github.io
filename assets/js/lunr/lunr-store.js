        "excerpt": "Following are rules for interacting with the world.   Resting   The best way to recover from difficult combats is to spend some time resting. The benefits you gain from a rest depend on the length of the rest. You can perform light activity during a rest, such as standing guard, setting up camp, or eating a meal. Stressful activies, including combat or enduring harsh weather, interrupt a rest.   If you take a 5-minute rest, you recover the ability to use any Encounter powers you have expended. If you take a 1-hour rest, you heal an amount equal to half of your Health stat (this effect cannot occur again until you take an 8-hour rest). If you take an 8-hour rest, during which you get at least 5 hours of sleep, you heal an amount equal to your Health stat, and you recover the ability to use any Daily powers you have expended.   NPC Attitude   What a non-player character thinks of the party will greatly affect how they interact with the players. NPCs have an attitude towards the party, which is one of the following values:      Helpful   The creature actively wishes to aid you, as long as doing so doesn’t go against its own goals or hurt its quality of life   Friendly   The creature likes you, and will generally agree to simple and easy requests   Indifferent   The creature doesn’t know you, or doesn’t care about you one way or the other   Unfriendly   The creature dislikes and distrusts you, and won’t agree to any of your requests   Hostile   The creature actively wishes to harm you, and might attack you or otherwise try to get in your way   Most NPCs start as indifferent towards the party. A creature you’re fighting is almost always hostile towards you. Aggressive or hurtful actions towards an NPC will greatly worsen their attitude towards you, while generous or kind actions towards an NPC might improve their attitude towards you.",

You draw or stow any number of items that are secured in easily accessible locations, such as a weapon in its holster or a potion in a belt pouch. Alternatively, you can grab an unattended or stored object, open a door, or produce some similar effect. If you’re interacting with the external world, you might have to attempt a die roll to determine if your Interact power was successful.

If you move across extremely difficult or hazardous terrain, the GM might ask you make a die roll to determine if your Stride power was successful.

The attack roll is a Strength roll for melee weapons or an Agility roll for ranged weapons. Weapons with the Finesse trait let you choose either Strength or Agility for the attack roll.   When you make a ranged Strike, you can optionally choose to make a long-range Strike to try to hit a distant target. If you do, you have disadvantage on the attack roll, but your Strike has double the range.                       Critical Success         You deal damage equal to 2 * the weapon’s base damage + the attack roll’s attribute                   Success         You deal damage equal to the weapon’s base damage + the attack roll’s attribute                                      Sustain                                                     Concentrate                                Requirements         You have at least one spell active with a sustained duration                  Choose one spell with a sustained duration you have in effect. The duration of that spell continues until the end of your next turn. Some spells might have slightly different or expanded effects if you sustain them. If your Sustain power is disrupted, the spell immediately ends.

        "title": "Basic Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are some common rules for the game.   Die Rolls   When you attempt a task that has a chance of failing, you roll dice to determine if your attempt succeeds or fails. All die rolls are associated one stat, called the bonus of the die roll. This stat is usually an attribute or a skill, but can be any number. The die roll is usually referred to by this bonus: if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Strength attribute, then it’s called a Strength roll, or if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Stealth skill, then it’s called a Stealth roll.   To make the die roll, roll 1d20 and add the bonus, and note the result. Your result measures how effectively you attempt the task. Compare this value to the DC set by the GM, using the table below. If you roll a 20 on the die, then your result is one level of success higher than it would normally be. If you roll a 1 on the die, then your result is one level of success lower than it would normally be.   Levels of Success          Result     Values     Description           Critical Success     DC + 10 or more     An exceptionally good result, with bonus positive effects           Success     DC + 0 ... DC + 9     You succeed at the task you were attempting           Failure     DC - 10 ... DC - 1     You fail at the task you were attempting           Critical Failure     DC - 11 or less     An exceptionally bad result, with possible negative effects      Difficulty Classes   The DC (Difficulty Class) of a die roll is usually determined by the GM based on how hard the task seems. The GM is encouraged to used the table below to help them decide the DC. Some abilities call for a die roll against a specific DC. For example, the Strike power calls for a die roll where the DC is your target’s Defense stat.   Sample Difficulties          Difficulty     DC     Description           Simple     10     Something a normal person could do with some effort           Average     15     A task a skilled professional could struggle with           Hard     20     Requires significant training to accomplish           Very Hard     25     Very difficult even for a skilled professional           Extremely Hard     30     Almost impossible except for the greatest masters alive           Impossible     40     At the edge of human achievement, never been done before      Advantage, Disadvantage, and Rerolls   Some effects can give you advantage or disadvantage on a die roll, representing a minor cicumstantial bonus or penalty. When you have advantage on a die roll, you roll the d20 twice and take the higher value. When you have disadvantage on a die roll, you roll the d20 twice and take the lower value. If you have both advantage and disadvantage on a die roll, you only roll the d20 once.   Some effects let you reroll a die roll after it’s made. When you do, repeat the exact same die roll, with the same bonuses, penalties, advantage, and disadvantage as the original. Then, you can pick whether to use the original die roll or the new one.   Turns in Combat   Characters take turns during combat, as who acts first can be very important. When a fight breaks out, everyone involved makes an Initiative roll. Whoever gets the highest result takes the first turn. On your turn, you can use one  power and any number of  powers. You can’t use the same  power more than once on the same turn.   At the end of your turn, you pick who takes the next turn, ally or enemy. If you attacked a creature, that creature can choose to Interrupt your choice and take the next turn instead. No matter what, no one can take multiple turns in the same round. The round ends once everyone has taken a turn. The person who took the last turn in the round chooses who starts the next round. If you took the last turn in a round, you can choose yourself to go first the next round.   Attacks   Some powers represent offensive effects designed to hurt or impede enemies. These are called Attack powers, or just attacks for short. Attacks always involve a die roll, called the attack roll. The attacker makes the the attack roll only once, no matter how many targets the attack has. The attack roll specifies which of the target’s stat to use as the DC, usually Defense or an attribute DC. Since each target can have a different value for this DC, an attack can hit one target but miss another.   For example, the Strike power is an attack. Imagine that Alice uses the Strike power, slashing at Bob with a sword. Alice makes a Strength attack roll against Bob’s Defense. If the result of Alice’s attack roll is equal to or higher than Bob’s Defense score, then Alice’s attack is a success, and deals damage as described in the Strike power.",

        "title": "Character Creation",
        "excerpt": "As in other tabletop RPGs, before beginning character creation, you should talk with your group about the general setting and style of your game. Ask your GM what character level you’re starting at, and if they’re using any custom rules. Finally, grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make.   Step 1. Choose your General Theme   The first step in making any character is deciding what you generally want your character to be. Will you be a powerful mage, casting arcane spells that reshape reality? A kung-fu master who can somersault and jump between enemies? A hardened soldier with a variety of weapons, who can tough through any situation?   In this step, you should develop these ideas more, working out the details of what you imagine your character will act and feel like. While you don’t have to write any of this down, you should keep it in mind as you create the rest of your character. The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.   Step 2. Determine Attribute Scores   The next step is to determine your character’s attributes. Characters in Forge of Power have 4 attributes: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Spirit. Your score in each attribute is a single number, which can range from -2 to +10. The average value of an attribute for a normal human is +0. See the Attributes page for a description of each attribute.   Your starting score in each attribute is a number between -1 and +3. You can choose any starting scores you want such that your scores sum to a total to 4. For example, you could start with +3 Strength, -1 Agility, +2 Intellect, and +0 Spirit, since 3 - 1 + 2 + 0 = 4. Write your score in each attribute on your character sheet.   Step 3. Choose your Skills   You now choose what skills your character specializes in. Skills are divided into two broad categories. Combat skills, which are always used during combat, represent your experience with types of weapons or magic. General skills represent your ability to perform non-combat tasks of all kinds. See the Skills page for a full list of all skills and their purpose in the game.   Your bonus to each skill is equal to your score in the skill’s attribute + your Proficiency in that skill. You start with +0 Proficiency in each skill. Many power schools increase your Proficiency in various combat skills. If multiple power schools set your Proficiency in a combat skill, you only take the highest value. You can also get skill boosts, which you can apply to a general skill to increase your Proficiency in that skill by 2.   You start with 4 skill boosts, which you must apply to different general skills. You gain another skill boost at every odd character level. This means that the total number of skill boosts you have is equal to 4 + half your character level, rounded up. No matter how many skill boosts you apply to a general skill, your Proficiency in that skill can’t increase beyond the maximum given in the table below:           Character Level     Max Proficiency           1 ... 4     +4           5 ... 10     +6           11 ... 16     +8           17 or more     +10      Step 4. Choose your Powers   Powers are a general term for all the special abilities your character has. They cover everything from basic actions to powerful spells. Most of character customizability comes from picking your character’s powers.   Basic powers are shared across all characters. Your character can use all the powers listed in the Basic Powers page. Learned powers are tied to particular power schools and must be learned before you can use them.   All learned powers are part of a power school, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 24 power schools in Forge of Power. See the Power Schools page for a full list of all power schools and their descriptions.   When you create your character, you split your character level between the power schools. Write your level in each power school on your character sheet. Your character level and your level in a school determine your tier in the school, as shown in the table below:           Tier     Character Level     School Level           Novice     1     1           Veteran     5     3           Master     11     5           Epic     17     7      Your character knows a number of powers from each power school equal to your level in that school. All learned powers have a tier, which is shown next to the power’s name. To learn a power, you must be at least that tier in the power’s school.   For example, imagine you are creating a level 5 character. You could choose to put 3 levels in Blaster and 2 levels in Duelist. This makes you a Veteran Blaster and a Novice Duelist. You then learn 3 powers from the Blaster school, all of which must be either Novice or Veteran. You also learn 2 powers from the Duelist school, both of which must be Novice.   As another example, imagine you are creating a level 11 character. You could choose to put all 11 levels in the Arcanist school. This makes you a Master Arcanist. You then learn 11 powers from the Arcanist school, all of which must be Novice, Veteran, or Master.   Step 5. Choose your Ribbons   In addition to powers, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are associated to power schools, and are very similar to powers, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities.   You learn one ribbon at every odd character level. This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You can’t pick ribbons from a power school that you have no levels in, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.   Step 6. Choose your ASIs/Feats   Your character becomes stronger in other ways than simply learning more powers. At every even level, you can choose to either get an Attribute Score Improvement (ASI) or a feat. This means that the total number of ASIs or feats you get is equal to half your character level, rounded down. This represents your character becoming stronger generally, in a way that isn’t tied to any specific power school.   If you choose to get an ASI, you increase your score in one attribute by 1 point, to a maximum of +5.   If you choose to get a feat, you learn one feat from the Feats page.   Step 7. Compute Miscellaneous Stats   You’re now almost finished making your character! The only game mechanics task remaining is to write down a few numbers describing various aspects of your character.   Character Level. Your character’s level describes your overall strength. Most characters are between levels 1 and 20, but this isn’t a hard limit. The GM determines what level your character is.   Health. Your Health measures how much damage you can take before falling unconscious. Your Health is equal to 20 + Character Level + 4 * Strength.   Defense. Your Defense measures how well you can avoid, dodge, or parry physical attacks. Your Defense is equal to 8 + an attribute determined by your apparel.   Stat DC. You have a DC for each of your attributes and your Perception. This measures how well you can defend against effects targeting that stat. Your DC for a given stat is equal to 10 + the stat.   Step 8. Buy Equipment   Don’t forget to buy equipment to use in your adventures! You start with (100 * your character level) gold pieces (gp). See the weapons and armor pages for stats. More tables for standard adventuring gear and magic items are on the way.   Step 9. Describe your Personality   What your character will choose to do is as important as what your character has the power to do. Every player character has a list of Quirks, which are unique personality traits or flaws that define them. Your Quirks act as a guide to help you roleplay your character, and are useful for Setbacks.   When you make your character, you should write down at least three Quirks that make you stand out. Feel free to add, modify, or remove Quirks at any time as your understanding of your character’s personality changes. The categories and random generators below can help give you ideas for your character’s Quirks.   Habits. These describe the obvious character actions that makes your character stand out from the average adventurer.     Weird Skills. These describe your character’s unique skills in strangely specific tasks, things you do better than anyone else.     Bonds. These describe the causes your character cares deeply about, the fundamental beliefs that drive you to act. They also describe the personal connections your character has with family, close friends, loved ones, organizations, or even special items.     Flaws. These describe character flaws that may impede your character and provide a source of narrative conflict.     Step 10. Write your Backstory   The final step in making a character is figuring out how you reached the start of the adventure. You should write down some basic notes about where your character was raised, any previous jobs you’ve held, and how you met the rest of the party. Your backstory is also the perfect place to introduce the NPC contacts that your character knows. The more detail you write, the better your GM will be able to merge this detail with the campaign setting.",

        "title": "Combat Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to combat. See the All Powers page for a list of common actions you can take in combat.   Power Properties   Some powers have a range in feet. If the power doesn’t list a target or an area, it targets one creature you can see within range.   Some powers have an area. If the power lists a range, the area is centered on a point you can see within range, otherwise the area is centered on you. If the power doesn’t list a target, it targets all creatures in the area.   Some powers have a duration. When the duration ends, the power’s effect completely ends. The world returns to its normal state, as if the power hadn’t been used. Any permanent changes the power made to the world, such as inflicting or healing damage, don’t disappear when the power ends. You can’t end an ongoing power early unless it specifies that in its duration.   Surprise   If you start combat with a creature that isn’t prepared for an imminent attack, that creature is surprised for the first round of combat. Creatures that are surprised, that can’t see you, or that otherwise aren’t expecting you to attack are flat-footed against you.   Falling   If there is nothing supporting your character, you fall. You fall up to 500 feet each round. When you fall 10 or more feet, you take 1d6 damage for each 10 feet, up to a cap of 50d6 damage at 500 feet. The number of dice is reduced by half if you fall onto a soft surface, such as a pile of hay or a pool of water. You land prone if you take any damage from a fall.   Cover   Some environmental features, such as battlements or arrow slits, make it much harder for creatures to hit you with attacks. At the GM’s discretion, these environmental features may give you cover from enemies. In general, you have cover from an enemy if at least 3/4 of your body is blocked by a solid object. If you have cover from an enemy, you have a +5 bonus to Defense against their attacks.   Health   All characters have a Health pool that represents how healthy they currently are. Your Health pool stores a number of points, up to a maximum of your Health stat. When you take damage, you must subtract the damage taken from your Health pool. When you heal, you add the points healed to your Health pool. Your Health pool can never go below 0. While your Health pool is 0, you have the downed condition.   Some effects can give you a pool of temporary HP. When you take damage, subtract the damage from your temporary HP first, then subtract any remaining damage from your Health pool. Multiple sources of temporary HP do not stack, you only keep the highest.   Dying   TODO: Write this section",

Depending on the weapon, it deals either Bludgeoning or Slashing damage.   When you make a bludgeon Strike, if your target calculates its Defense with Strength, the bludgeon deals 1d10 base damage instead of 1d8 base damage.                 Bow                       Two-Handed             A bow is a ranged weapon that deals 1d8 Piercing base damage and has a range of 100 feet.

Some polearms, such as short spears or lances, are built for use in one hand. These polearms are One-Handed instead of Two-Handed and deal 1d8 base damage instead of 1d12 base damage.   Your reach with a polearm is 5 feet longer than your normal reach. You have disadvantage on polearm Strikes while you are adjacent to multiple walls, such as while standing in the corner of a room or in a 5-foot tunnel.                 Shield                       One-Handed             While wielding a shield, you calculate your Defense with Strength, no matter what apparel you’re wearing. While wielding a shield and wearing heavy armor, you have a +1 bonus to Defense.

If the Strike is a critical success, the sword deals 1d12 base damage instead of 1d6 base damage.                 Throwing Weapon                       One-Handed             A throwing weapon is a melee weapon that deals 1d6 base damage. Depending on the weapon, it deals either Bludgeoning or Slashing damage.   A throwing weapon can be thrown as a ranged weapon with a range of 40 feet. Ranged Strikes with throwing weapons use Strength for the attack roll instead of Agility. When you succeed on a ranged Strike with a throwing weapon, you can use the Slowing Hit power.      Slowing Hit    Your target’s Speed decreases by 10 feet until the end of your next turn                 Unarmed      Your punch or kick counts as a melee weapon that deals 1d4 Bludgeoning base damage.   While you have no hands free, you have disadvantage on unarmed Strikes.                 Wand                       One-Handed             While wielding a wand, you can use the Reliable Casting power.

        "excerpt": "Hello, and welcome to the core rulebook of Forge of Power! I assume that if you’re reading this, you’re already familiar with tabletop RPGs, like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, or Shadowrun. After years of playing these games, I found rules that I wanted to change, new mechanics I wanted to introduce, and interesting ideas I wanted to combine. The result was this system, Forge of Power, that takes all my favorite mechanics from across many systems and merges them together. I think the whole has become more than the sum of its parts.   Versatile Character Creation   Forge of Power tries to maximize the number of options available in character creation. Unlike D&amp;D or Pathfinder, characters in Forge of Power do not choose a single class that determines what your character does. Instead, whenever a character levels up, they can choose a talent, a special ability that makes the character much stronger in one way. Talents are organized by theme into collections of related talents, called talent schools. Characters are free to mix and match talents from different talent schools, letting you pick the perfect combination of talents to realize your character’s theme.   To expand your options even further, talent schools have minor abilities called ribbons, which make characters more flavorful or thematic, without greatly affecting your combat power. Ribbons separate out combat strength from roleplaying abilities, making it so every character always has unique strengths to offer both in combat and in social interactions.   Tactical Combat   Like many other roleplaying games, Forge of Power puts a heavy emphasis on combat. The game rules try to make combat as interesting as possible for all characters. All characters, magical and martial, have access to the same number of powers. This means that the fighter will have just as many interesting options to use in combat as the wizard. A lot of effort has been spent trying to balance the various powers against each other. No strategy in combat should ever clearly be much stronger than another.   Setting   Forge of Power was designed around a medieval fantasy world, just like D&amp;D or Pathfinder. Players can expect a setting where brave paladins fight against cunning devils, elven wizards duel against ancient dragons, and adventurers regularly delve into dungeons to slay monsters and recover hidden treasures. That said, the game rules never assume the game uses a specific setting, and groups can play this system in a universe of their choice. Forge of Power can be adapted to completely different settings with only minor modifications. Running a futuristic sci-fi game only requires changing the equipment list to add plasma guns, lightsabers, and spaceships. Running a realistic medieval game is as simple as banning all the “magical” power schools.",

        "title": "Narrative Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are rules that help groups play out interesting stories.  ## Aspects  TODO: Write this section  ## Quests  The game is divided into **quests**, each of which has a single well-defined objective. Each quest has a current **Challenge** score, which usually starts at 1. When the party completes a quest, everyone gains XP equal to the quest’s Challenge score. A player character levels up whenever they reach a multiple of 10 XP.  Whenever the GM adds a complication to the quest, they should increase the Challenge by 1. Especially deadly complications might increase the Challenge by 2 or more.  The party can vote to spend 1 Challenge point to introduce a reasonable plot point that makes the quest easier, such as calling in allies to help, or adding a lucky coincidence that works in their favor. The GM determines whether a proposed plot point would be reasonable. Introducing a plot point can only trivialize the quest if it reduces the Challenge to 0.  ## Inspiration  Every player has a pool of **inspiration** points that they can spend to influence the story. You can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any die roll that any character makes. When you do, you must explain how your character somehow influences the roll. Even just yelling a few words of moral support counts.  You start every session with 1 inspiration point. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration. You can also earn inspiration through Setbacks (see below). Unspent inspiration goes away at the end of a session.  ## Setbacks  In books, movies, and shows, we constantly see characters act against their best interests. This makes for interesting, realistic stories of complex, flawed characters. These self-imposed setbacks often act to reinforce the theme of a story. A comedy show relies on exagerrated, silly characters who make humorous mistakes. A grim drama relies on characters with emotional scars that flare up at the worst times.  Forge of Power encourages these stories by compensating players for in-character setbacks. At any time, a player can propose a **Setback**, explaining how a character might act in a way that makes the current quest harder for the entire party. The proposed action has to match the game's theme: if you're running a comedic game, the Setback must be humorous, or if you're running a grimdark game, the Setback must be dark or hurtful. The proposed action must also directly relate to one of the character's Aspects.  The player who controls the character (or the GM, if the character is an NPC) can then choose to accept or reject the proposed Setback. If they accept the Setback, then the proposed action occurs in the game. Both the player who proposed the Setback and the player controlling the character gain 1 inspiration (if you Setback your own character, you gain 2 inspiration). The current quest's Challenge score increases by 1.  Setbacks have a few limitations. First, many Setbacks require an in-character action that can be blocked by other characters. For example, if the reckless character tries to charge into a fight, their party might grab them before they run off. If the action is blocked by other characters, the Setback is cancelled. Second, the same character can't be the cause of a Setback twice in a row. (The same player *can* propose two Setbacks in a row, if they want.) Third, you can't Setback the same Aspect twice in the same game session.",

        "title": "Spell Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to spells.  ## Casting Spells  A power with the [[Spell]] trait is called a **spell**. Using such a power is called **casting** the spell. Casting a spell requires speaking a command phrase and making hand gestures, which usually make it obvious that you are casting a spell. All spells implicitly have the [[Concentrate]] and [[Manipulate]] traits.  Casting spells requires an **arcane focus**, which is a handheld item you use to channel your magic. You can meditate or focus for 1 hour to designate an item as your arcane focus. Bonding to a new arcane focus severs your connection with your previous focus. You can pick any item as your arcane focus - a staff, a book, a crystal gem, a sword, or so on. You must hold your arcane focus in one hand while casting a spell or using the {Sustain} power.  ## Mana  All characters that can cast spells have a Mana pool that represents how much magical energy they have available. Your Mana pool stores a number of points, up to a maximum of your Mana stat. When you pay Mana to cast a spell, you must subtract the amount paid from your Mana pool. Your Mana pool can never go below 0. Your [arcane background](spell-rules.html#arcane-backgrounds) determines your Mana stat and describes when your Mana pool replenishes.  All spells have a **cost** in Mana. You must pay this amount of Mana when you cast the spell. If you don't have enough Mana, you can't cast the spell. Some effects reduce the cost of a spell. You must always spend at least 1 Mana when you cast a spell, or at least 0 Mana if the spell has the [[Cantrip]] trait.  ## Heightening Spells  You can **heighten** some spells to increase their effect, at the cost of paying more Mana to use the spell. When you cast a spell, you can choose to pay more Mana than the listed cost, up to a limit of half your character's total Mana.  If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (per +X Mana)**, then for each X Mana you pay above the base cost, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (total X Mana)**, then if you pay a total of at least X mana, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's descriptions has multiple **Heightened** enties, then all of them apply.  ## Customizing Spells  Spells are flexible effects, and the caster has significant leeway in choosing how the spell is expressed. A powerful spellcaster who conjures vast firestorms could use that same spell to light a single candle. You can reduce the area, range, duration, or damage of a spell as much as you want when you cast the spell, though the cost stays the same. Ask your GM what other parameters you can change for a given spell. Once you cast the spell, you no longer have direct control over the magic, so you have to pick any changes when you cast the spell.  Players are encouraged to describe their spells differently than how they're described in the rules. For example, instead of describing your {Fireball} spell as an explosion of flames, you could describe it as a flash of lightning, an intense wave of radiation, or as briefly transporting targets to a Hell dimension. Your unique description for your spell is called the spell's Trappings.  Trappings shouldn't change how a spell functions in normal circumstances. The GM might say that Trappings change how a spell acts in unusual circumstances, such as a flash of lightning being more effective than a fireball when the target is underwater. Creatively using spells is cool, and should be encouraged.  ## Arcane Backgrounds  When you learn your first spell, you choose one arcane background from the list below. Your arcane background determines your Magic and Mana stats, and gives you unique extra bonuses.  ### Artificer  You cast magic spells through building items with magical effects.  ***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Intellect.  ***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.  ***Bonuses.*** TODO  ### Bard  You cast magic spells through performance, stories, or creative art.  ***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Spirit.  ***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.  ***Bonuses.*** TODO  ### Cleric  You cast magic spells through faith and devotion to your religion.  ***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Spirit.  ***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.  ***Bonuses.*** When you reach Novice tier in a Priest power school, choose one spell in that school as your **domain spell** in that school. The cost of your domain spell is reduced by 1.  ### Psion  You cast magic spells through intense focus and strength of will.  ***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Spirit.  ***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.  ***Bonuses.*** You don't need an arcane focus to cast or sustain spells.  ### Warlock  You cast magic spells through a bargain with an extraplanar entity.  ***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Intellect.  ***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 1-hour rest.  ***Bonuses.*** When you finish an 8-hour rest, you can try to bargain with your patron for more power. Make a Spirit roll against DC 15. On a success, your Mana stat increases by 4. On a failure, your Mana stat decreases by 4. Both effects end when you complete another 8-hour rest.  ### Wizard  You cast magic spells through intense study and memorization.  ***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Intellect.  ***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.  ***Bonuses.*** When you reach Novice tier in a Mage power school, you learn one [[Cantrip]] power from that school. This power doesn't count towards the normal limit of powers you know in that school.",

        "excerpt": "Berserkers are aggressive melee fighters who believe that the best defense is a good offense. They charge into enemy lines, lay waste to their opponents, and refuse to give up and die. Berserkers are notoriously angry, and are adept at channeling their rage into combat power.   Berserker talents give amazing boosts to melee damage. Some of their talents help them resist damage, but others lower their own defense in exchange for damage. Some berserker talents let them resist death or heal when they attack others. Berserker ribbons offer a variety of social and utility effects.   Examples of berserkers in fiction include Conan the Barbarian, the Hulk from Marvel Comics, and most fictional viking warriors.

        "excerpt": "Duelists are expert melee fighters who rely on their amazing skill with weapons. They excel in the art of the duel, specializing in one-on-one combat. Many duelists come from noble or gladiatorial backgrounds, where skill and elegance in combat are highly valued. Duelists most often wield swords.   Duelist talents focus on accurate attacks and impenetrable defenses. Many of their talents give them the change to add another attack in a moment of opportunity or weakness in their opponent’s defenses. Duelist ribbons let them show off their skill and knowledge of all sorts of weapons.   Examples of duelists in fiction include Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher, Link from The Legend of Zelda, and Drizzt Do’Urden from The Forgotten Realms.

        "excerpt": "Guardians are defensive fighters who use shields and heavy armor to protect themselves and their allies. They fight in the front lines as vanguards who distract attention from their more vulnerable allies. Many guardians are altruistic and supportive fighters who focus on defending others before themselves.   Guardian talents greatly increase defense against all attacks and spells. Many guardian talents distract enemies from your allies and force them to attack only you instead.

        "excerpt": "Swordsages are mystical fighters who perform supernatural feats of martial ability. They often fight in melee, but many swordsages try to avoid the front lines. Swordsages’ supernatural abilities come from their innate ki powers, which they might have unlocked through years of meditation and training.   Swordsage talents produce a variety of supernatural effects without relying on formal arcane magic. Their talents might create mirages of multiple attacks, turn the swordsage incorporeal as they dodge, or shape their ki into solid objects. Swordsage ribbons use ki for minor utility effects.   Examples of swordsages in fiction include almost all anime fighters that have supernatural abilities, as well as some high fantasy magic swordsmen and wuxia heroes.

Warblades can specialize in any combination of offense, defense, and utility, depending on what maneuvers they choose.

Acrobats are known for their supernatural abilities to move on difficult terrain, running up walls, along water, or even walking on thin air.   Acrobat talents focus on movement and dodging attacks. The majority of acrobat talents are defensive, though a few give opportunities to disorient enemies or counterattack. Some acrobat talents combine movement and combat, giving stat bonuses for using the environment to your advantage. Acrobat talents give even more ways to move around the world.   Examples of acrobats in fiction include Ty Lee from Avatar: The Last Airbender, Spiderman from Marvel Comics, all the protagonists of Assassin’s Creed, and most fictional monks and swashbucklers.

        "excerpt": "Hunters are ranged warriors who focus on taking down targets with precise, deadly shots. They are unmatched when it comes to chasing and defeating single targets, as enemies can’t flee from their range and accuracy. Most hunters avoid fighting in melee, preferring to use their range to their advantage.   Hunter talents give a variety of boosts to ranged weapons and single-target attacks. Some talents give buffs to single long-range shots with high accuracy and damage, while others give buffs to attacks against specific targets.

        "excerpt": "Masterminds are leaders who support their team in and out of combat. They might be inspirational warriors who lead from the front, but they can also be noncombatants who lend aid without interfering directly. Masterminds are known for their supernatural planning abilities, staying three steps ahead of their enemies at all times.   Mastermind talents focus on supporting allies instead of acting directly. Many of these talents give tactical combat bonuses, letting their allies have extra actions, damage, or defense. Masterminds have almost no talents that affect only themselves.

You explain the details of your plan, which retroactively become fact. You cannot change any established events in the story, and your plan must be something that you could have reasonably prepared within the past 24 hours. Your plan cannot involve any actions that would require die rolls to succeed.   For example, if you are investigating a dungeon, you could announce that you remembered to bring 100 feet of rope and a grappling hook, as you had anticipated that you might fall down a chasm. Alternatively, if you are in a meeting with the evil mayor, you could announce that you had arranged for the captain of the guard to be wandering by at just the right time, as you had predicted that the mayor would reveal his plan as this exact time. The GM has final say on whether any plan is reasonable.

        "excerpt": "Scoundrels are sneaky fighters who prefer trickery to fighting fair. They are experts in twisting combats to their advantage, distracting and misdirecting enemies. Most scoundrels favor stealth and surprise attacks over direct combat. Scoundrels have a generally negative reputation as thieves, liars, and assassins.   Scoundrel talents give many ways to confuse or avoid enemies. They also include ways to exploit a distraction for all it’s worth, with powerful sneak attacks and finishing moves. Scoundrel talents also let them escape danger through luck or stealth. Scoundrel ribbons give more ways to sneak around and avoid getting caught.   Examples of scoundrels in fiction include Han Solo from Star Wars, Batman from DC Comics, Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Carribean, and Corvo Attano from Dishonored.

Quick Draw                                   Novice             You draw your weapon and attack with the same motion.

Sneak Attack                         Novice             When your enemy can’t properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the flat-footed condition, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. The weapon you Strike with must be a ranged weapon, or must have the agile or finesse trait.   As your level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.

Nimble Roll                         Veteran                              Prerequisites         Nimble Dodge                  You throw yourself into a roll to escape imminent danger. You can use Nimble Dodge before attempting a Reflex save in addition to its original trigger. If you do, the circumstance bonus applies to your Reflex save against the triggering effect.   When you use Nimble Dodge and the triggering attack fails or criticalls fails, or when you succeed or critically succeed at the saving throw, you can also Stride up to 10 feet as part of the reaction. If you do, the reaction gains the Move trait.

When you succeed or critically succeed at a Strike against a creature that isn’t flat-footed, you also deal 1d6 precision damage. This applies only if you’re using a weapon you could Sneak Attack with. This damage increases to 2d6 at 14th level.

You take half damage from the triggering attack.                             Impossible Striker                         Epic                              Prerequisites         Sly Striker                  Your attacks are swift and deadly beyond explanation. Nothing can prevent you from making a sneak attack, even if your opponent can see every blow coming. Instead of dealing the damage from Sly Striker, you can deal your full Sneak Attack damage to a target even if the target isn’t flat-footed.                             Master Strike                                   Epic                            Incapacitation                                Trigger         Your Strike hits a flat-footed creature and deals damage                  The target attempts a Fortitude save against a DC of 10 + Precision + Prof. It then becomes temporarily immune to your Master Strike for 1 day.                       Critical Success         The target is unaffected                   Success         The target takes a -2 penalty to Strength until the end of your next turn                   Failure         The target is paralyzed for 4 rounds                   Critical Failure         The target is paralyzed for 4 rounds, knocked unconscious for 2 hours, or killed (your choice)",

When you cast a spell, if the spell deals damage and doesn’t have a duration, you gain a bonus to that spell’s damage equal to your Blaster level.

The target must attempt a Reflex save. The electricity arcs to another creature within 30 feet of the first target, jumps to another creature within 30 feet of that target, and so on. You can end the chain at any point. You can’t target the same creature more than once, and you must be able to see all targets. Roll the damage only once, and apply it to each target. The chain ends if any target critical succeeds at its save.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The damage increases by 1d12                             Disintegrate                                   Master                            Attack              Spell                                Cost         6 Mana              Range         120 feet                  You fire a green ray at your target. Make a spell attack. If you hit, you deal 12d10 damage, or twice as much on a critical hit. A creature reduced to 0 HP is reduced to fine powder. An object you hit is destroyed if it would fit within a 10-foot cube, regardless of its HP, unless it’s an artifact or similarly hard to destroy.                             Polar Ray                                   Master                            Attack              Cold              Spell                                Cost         8 Mana              Range         120 feet                  You fire a blue-white ray of freezing air and swirling sleet from your finger that can chill your target to the bones. You must succeed at a spell attack roll to affect the target, which then takes 10d8 damage and is drained 2.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The damage increases by 2d8                             Implosion                                   Epic                            Spell                                Cost         9 Mana              Range         30 feet              Save         Fortitude              Duration         Sustained, up to 1 minute                  You crush the target by causing it to collapse in on itself, dealing 75 damage. Each time you Sustain the spell, you must choose a new target to be subject to the same effect. You can’t target the same creature twice during a single casting of this spell, you can’t Sustain this spell multiple times per turn, and you can’t target a creature that lacks a solid form.                             Meteor Swarm                                   Epic                            Spell                                Cost         9 Mana              Range         500 feet              Save         Reflex                  You call down four meteors that explode in fiery blasts. Each meteor deals 6d10 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 10-foot burst, then explodes, dealing 14d6 fire damage to all creatures in a 40-foot burst. A creature hit by multiple meteors takes damage only once.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d10, and the fire damage increases by 2d6",

The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn’t change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can change the appearance of your clothing and worn items, but held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance.      Heightened (total 2 Mana)   The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the Auditory trait   Heightened (total 3 Mana)   You can appear as any creature of the same size, even a specific individual as long as you’ve seen them before   Heightened (total 6 Mana)   You can target up to 10 creatures within 30 feet                             Illusory Object                                   Novice                            Visual              Spell                                Cost         1 Mana              Range         500 feet              Area         20-foot burst              Duration         10 minutes                  You create an illusory visual image of a stationary object. The entire image must fit within the spell’s area. The object appears to animate naturally, but it doesn’t make sounds or generate smells. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.      Heightened (total 2 Mana)   Your image makes appropriate sounds, generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. The spell gains the Auditory trait. The duration increases to 1 hour.   Heightened (total 5 Mana)   The duration is unlimited.                             Invisibility                                   Novice                            Spell                                Cost         2 Mana              Range         Touch              Duration         10 minutes                  Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes invisible. This makes it hidden from all creatures that rely on sight. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends after that action is completed.      Heightened (total 4 Mana)   The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn’t end if the target uses a hostile action                             Phantom Pain                                   Novice                            Mental              Spell                                Cost         1 Mana              Range         30 feet              Save         Will              Duration         1 minute                  Illusory pain wracks the target, dealing 2d4 mental damage and 1d4 persistent mental damage. The target must attempt a Will save.                       Critical Success         The target is unaffected                   Success         The target takes full initial damage but no persistent damage, and the spell ends immediately                   Failure         The target takes full initial and persistent damage, and the target is sickened 1                   Critical Failure         As failure, but the target is sickened 2                                    Illusory Scene                         Veteran                              Prerequisites         Illusory Object                  Your Illusory Object power can form a scene that includes up to 10 moving creatures or objects. You can have each part of the scene follow a repeating program up to 1 minute long. A creature that interacts with one part of your image only disbelieves that portion.                             Phantasmal Killer                                   Veteran                            Death              Emotion              Fear              Mental              Spell                                Cost         4 Mana              Range         120 feet              Save         Will                  You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the target. Only the spell’s target can see the killer, though you can see the vague shape of the illusion as it races forth to attack. The effect of the killer is based on the outcome of the target’s Will save.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The damage increases by 1d6 on a success, by 2d6 on a failure, and by 3d6 on a critical failure                       Critical Success         The target is unaffected                   Success         The target takes 4d6 mental damage and is frightened 1                   Failure         The target takes 8d6 mental damage and is frightened 2                   Critical Failure         The target is so afraid it might die. It must attempt a Fortitude save (with the Incapacitation trait); if the target fails, it dies. On a successful Fortitude save, the target takes 12d6 mental damage, is fleeing until the end of its next turn, and is frightened 4.                                    Shadow Siphon                                   Veteran                            Shadow              Spell                                Cost         5 Mana              Range         60 feet              Trigger         A spell or magical effect within range deals damage                  Exchanging material energy with shadows, you transform the triggering spell into a partially illusory version of itself. Any creatures that would be damaged by the spell instead take only half as much damage, but the spell otherwise works as normal.                             Project Image                                   Master                            Mental              Spell                                Cost         7 Mana              Range         30 feet              Duration         Sustained up to 1 minute                  You project an illusory image of yourself. You must stay within range of the image, and if at any point you can’t see the image, the spell ends. Whenever you cast a spell, you can cause the spell effect to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the image is an illusion, it isn’t a creature and can’t benefit from spells. The image has the same AC and saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.      Heightened (total 9 Mana)   The maximum duration you can Sustan the spell increases to 10 minutes                             Weird                         Epic                              Prerequisites         Phantasmal Killer                  When you spend at least 8 Mana on Phantasmal Killer, the spell targets any number of creatures within range.

Make a Sorcery roll against the Spell DC of the creature that cast the spell. If you succeed, the target spell immediately ends.

If the next action you use is to cast a spell, you modify the spell in one of the following ways.      Reach   Increase the spell’s range by 30 feet   Silent   The spell doesn’t require verbal components   Widen   If the spell’s area is a burst, increase its radius by 5 feet, or if the spell’s area is a line or cone, increase its length by 10 feet                             Misty Step                                   Novice                            Spell              Teleportation                                Cost         2 Mana              Range         30 feet                  You disappear in a swirl of mist, reappearing in a different location. You and any items you’re wearing or holding teleport to a clear space within range you can see.                             Dimension Door                                   Veteran                            Spell              Teleportation                                Cost         4 Mana              Range         120 feet                  Opening a door that bypasses normal space, you instantly transport yourself and any items you’re wearing or holding from your current space to a clear space within range you can see. If you attempt to bring another creature with you, the power fails.      Heightened (total 5 Mana)   The range increases to 1 mile, and you don’t need to be able to see your destination, as long as you have been there in the past and know its relative location and distance from you                             Greater Metamagic                         Veteran                              Prerequisites         Metamagic                  You can modify your spells in a broad variety of ways. Your Metamagic power gains the following options.      Conservation   If you spend at least 1 Mana on the spell, one spell you cast next turn costs 1 Mana less   Overwhelming   The spell ignores any resistances to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage   Quickened   The spell takes 2 fewer actions to cast, but the strain involved means you can’t use Metamagic again until you take a long rest                             Resilient Sphere                                   Veteran                            Force              Spell                                Cost         4 Mana              Range         30 feet              Duration         1 minute                  You create an immobile sphere of force to either trap or protect the target, blocking anything that would pass through the sphere. The sphere has AC 5, Hardness 10, and 40 HP. It’s immune to critical hits and precision damage. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Reflex save, with the following effect.                       Critical Success         The target disrupts the sphere’s integrity, causing it to collapse entirely                   Success         The sphere functions normally but has only 10 HP instead of 40                   Failure         The sphere has its normal effect                                         Redirect Gravity                                   Master                            Spell                                Cost         7 Mana              Range         120 feet              Area         30-foot burst              Duration         1 minute                  You change the direction of gravity in the area. Creatures and objects that aren’t secured to the ground immediately fall towards the new direction you designate as down. Rules for falling and fall damage apply as normal. A creature partially inside the area is caught between normal and redirected gravity, and is pulled in both directions at once.                             Reflect Spell                         Master                              Prerequisites         Counterspell                  When you use Counterspell to counteract a spell that affects targeted creatures or an area, you can turn that spell’s effect back on its caster. When reflected, the spell affects only the original caster, even if it’s area spell or it would normally affect more than one creature. The original caster can attempt a save and use other defenses against the reflected spell as normal.                             Metamagic Mastery                         Epic                              Prerequisites         Metamagic                  Altering your spells doesn’t take any longer than casting them normally. You can use Metamagic as a Free power.                             Time Stop                                   Epic                            Spell                                Cost         10 Mana                  You temporarily stop time for everything but yourself, allowing you to use several actions in what appears to others to be no time at all. Immediately after using this power, you take 3 turns. Rounds only pass for you, effects specifically targeting or affecting you, and effects you create during the stoppage. All other creatures and objects are invulnerable and can’t be targeted or affected by anything. Once you have finished your turns, time begins to flow again for the rest of the world.                             Augury                                   Novice                            Divination               You gain a vague glimpse of the future. When you cast this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveals the GM’s best guess among the following outcomes:                  Weal       The results will be good                       Woe       The results will be bad                       Weal and Woe       The results will be a mix of good and bad                       Nothing       There won’t be particularly good or bad results           The GM secretly rolls a d4. On a 1, the result is always “nothing”. If anyone casts Augury again to ask about the same topic, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting, though if circumstances change, it’s possible to get a different result.                             Guidance                                   Novice                              Range         30 feet              Duration         Until the start of your next turn                  You see briefly into the future, granting the target a +1 bonus to one die roll they attempt before the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before rolling, after which the spell ends. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.                             True Strike                                   Novice                            Fortune                                Duration         Until the end of your turn                  A glimpse into the future ensures your next blow strikes true. The next time you make an attack, roll the attack twice and use the better result. The attack ignores any penalties to the roll.                             Portent                         Novice             Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish an 8-hour rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled.

The fog completely obscures vision, making sight impossible and nullifying Visual effects. The fog partially obscures sound, imposing disadvantage on Auditory attacks and die rolls to hear things within the area.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The radius of the burst increases by 20 feet                             Elemental Bolt                                   Novice                            Attack              Cantrip              Spell                                Cost         0 Mana              Range         120 feet                  Make a Magic attack roll against your target’s defense.

On a success, your target takes 3d6 damage and falls prone. On a failure, your target takes half damage. In either case, the ground in a 10-foot burst around your target becomes difficult terrain, as spikes or pillars of earth persist on the landscape.      Heightened (total 3 Mana)   This power gains an area of a 10-foot burst, and the damage is doubled against structures   Heightened (total 5 Mana)   The damage increases to 5d6, and the area increases to a 20-foot burst                             Wind Blast                                   Novice                            Attack              Spell                                Cost         1 Mana              Range         60 feet              Area         30-foot line                  Make a Magic attack roll against your target’s Strength DC. You have advantage on the attack roll if your target is flying. On a success, your target takes 1d6 damage and is pushed back 10 feet.      Heightened (per +2 Mana)   The damage increases by 1d6 and the knockback increases by 10 feet                             Fly                                   Veteran                            Spell                                Cost         3 Mana              Range         Touch              Duration         10 minutes                  Your target gains a fly speed of 60 feet.

The water is pure and safe to drink. This spell creates a total of 1 gallon of water.      Heightened (per +1 Mana, up to a maximum of +6 Mana)   This power’s range extends by 10 feet, and you create 10 times as much water                             Feather Fall                                   Ribbon                            Spell                                Cost         1 Mana              Trigger         You see a creature fall              Range         60 feet              Target         Up to three falling creatures you can see within range              Duration         1 minute, or until a target stops falling                  Your target slows down in midair, falling only 60 feet each round, and they are immune to fall damage.

This puts out small fires and freezes small bodies of water. This effect isn’t powerful enough to affect large objects, creatures, or magical heat sources.      Heightened (total 2 Mana)   This power gains the Attack trait and targets all creatures in the area that are partially submerged in water. Make a Magic attack roll against your target’s Agility DC. On a success, your target takes 2d8 damage and is restrained until the end of your next turn.

The flame isn’t large enough to be effective as an attack.      Heightened (total 1 Mana)   This power gains a range of 30 feet, and targets an unattended object you can see within range. The flame does burn your target, quickly setting fire to a flammable target.   Heightened (total 2 Mana)   This power gains a range of 60 feet, gains an area of a 20-foot burst, and targets all unattended objects in the area                             Tremorsense                         Ribbon                              Range         30 feet                  You perceive all creatures and objects within range that you are connected to by a path of a solid material. If this material is entirely hard earth or stone, then your sense is as accurate as vision or touch. Otherwise, your sense is less accurate, and you have disadvantage on rolls that depend on perceiving a target. Your sense doesn’t work at all through soft materials, such as sand or water.",
