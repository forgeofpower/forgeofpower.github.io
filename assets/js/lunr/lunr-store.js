        "excerpt": "Following are rules for interacting with the world.   Resting   The best way to recover from difficult combats is to spend some time resting. The benefits you gain from a rest depend on the length of the rest. You can perform light activity during a rest, such as standing guard, setting up camp, or eating a meal. Stressful activies, including combat or enduring harsh weather, interrupt a rest.   If you take a 5-minute rest, you recover the ability to use any Encounter powers you have expended. You can also choose to gain 1 fatigue to heal half of your missing health.   If you take an 8-hour rest, during which you get at least 5 hours of sleep, you heal to full health, you recover 1 fatigue, and you recover the ability to use any Daily powers you have expended.   Carrying Capacity   Your carrying capacity is determined by your Strength and your Size. This value represents the maximum weight you can lift without too much trouble. You can lift up to twice this weight for a short time.   To compute your carrying capacity, plug your Strength into the table below. If your Size is greater than +0, multiply the result by 4 for each +1. If your Size is less than +0, divide the result by 4 for each -1.           Strength     Carrying Capacity      -550 lbs   -457 lbs   -366 lbs   -276 lbs   -187 lbs   +0100 lbs   +1110 lbs   +2130 lbs   +3150 lbs   +4170 lbs   +5200 lbs   +6230 lbs   +7260 lbs   +8300 lbs   +9350 lbs   +10400 lbs   Reputation   Your character will make many friends and enemies along their journeys. The reputation mechanic gives the party a way to track exactly how various groups feel about them.   Your character has a Reputation score with every NPC and every group of NPCs. This score is normally at 0, which represents a neutral reputation: the other party neither likes you nor dislikes you. A positive score represents a positive reputation: the other party likes you and may be willing to help you. A negative score represents a negative reputation: the other party dislikes you and may be unwilling to help you.   When you make a die roll to socially interact with an NPC, the GM may ask you to add your Reputation score with that NPC to your roll. This represents cases where a positive reputation is beneficial. For example, you could be trying to convince a merchant to give you a better dela, you could be persuading an town governor to heed your advice, or you could be asking a favor from a close ally.   In rare cases, the GM may ask you to subtract your Reputation score from a die roll. This represents cases where a negative reputation can be beneficial. For example, you could be trying to intimidate an NPC based on your reputation as a pirate, you could be trying to rile up a crowd that dislikes you, or you could be trying to taunt an enemy that has specific reason to hate you.   Building a Reputation   Just like in real life, a positive reputation more useful than a negative reputation, but a negative reputation is easier to build. It is also easier to build a strong reputation with an individual than with a large group, because it is difficult to influence a large group of people at once.   You can increase your Reputation score with a group by helping that group, especially if you don’t ask for anything in return. Completeting a quest that helps someone usually affects your Reputation score as follows:     If you helped an individual person, you gain +5 Reputation with them   If you helped a small group of people, you gain +2 Reputation with them   If you helped a large group of people, you gain +1 Reputation with them   While gaining reputation requires acts of charity and performing favors, losing reputation is as easy as accidentally saying the wrong thing. Majorly insulting someone usually affects your Reputation score as follows:     If you insulted an individual person, you have -5 Reputation with them   If you insulted a small group of people, you have -2 Reputation with them   If you insulted a large group of people, you have -1 Reputation with them   A small group of people means roughly 10-100 people. A large group of people means 100 or more.   The GM determines how exactly any action affects your Reputation score. Use common sense when determining the impact of an action on a character’s reputation. A minor favor is unlikely to improve your Reputation score at all, while sacrificing yourself to save someone will give you much more than +5 Reputation with them. Similarly, a minor insult won’t hurt your Reputation score if you apologize, but seriously attacking someone might give you -20 Reputation with them or worse.   Example   Alice the Acrobat and Bob the Berserker went on a quest to save the princess from an evil dragon that has been menacing the countryside. They return victorious from their quest, to great public fanfare and a personal thanks from the king!   Alice and Bob helped the entire kingdom by slaying the dragon, so they gain +1 Reputation with everyone in the kingdom. In addition, Alice and Bob personally helped the princess and the king, so they gain +5 Reputation with each of them. Since the princess and the king are both part of the kingdom, these stack, so Alice and Bob gain a total of +6 Reputation with the royal family from this victory.   While enthusiatically celebrating their victory, Bob the Berserker gets into a drunken brawl at the local tavern, and is arrested by the guard. Alice the Acrobat goes to speak with the guard captain to plead for Bob’s release. She rolls Spirit+Eloquence, with an additional +1 bonus from her Reputation score with the captain. If she fails this roll, Alice may have to involve the king, in which case she would add her +6 Reputation with the king to her roll.   Bob the Berserker’s escaped personally inconvenienced the guard captain, who was pulled away from the victory celebrations to make the arrest. The guard captain took this as a personal insult, and Bob has -5 Reputation with the captain. Alice wasn’t involved, so her Reputation score with the captain stays intact.   NPC Attitude   One simple way to describe a creature’s feelings towards the party is to give their attitude. An intelligent NPC’s attitude is usually determined by the party’s Reputation score with them, as shown in the table below. Unintelligent creatures still hold an attitude towards the party, even if they aren’t smart enough to understand reputations.           Reputation     Attitude     Description           +20 or more     Helpful     The creature actively wishes to aid you, as long as doing so doesn't go against its own goals or hurt its quality of life           +10 ... +19     Friendly     The creature likes you, and will generally agree to simple and easy requests           -9 ... +9     Indifferent     The creature doesn't know you, or doesn't care about you one way or the other           -19 ... -10     Unfriendly     The creature dislikes and distrusts you, and won't agree to any of your requests           -20 or less     Hostile     The creature actively wishes to harm you, and might attack you or otherwise try to get in your way      Most creatures start as indifferent towards the party. A creature you’re fighting is almost always hostile towards you.",

This lets you use the same  power twice in one turn. For instance, you could Stride twice to move twice as far, Interact twice to interact with more objects, or Sustain twice to keep more spells active at once.                                   Seek                                                                           You try to gain information about the world in some way                                 Concentrate               You seek out a specific piece of information about the world, such as by looking for a creature or trying to recall a fact. If you’re trying to do something difficult, such as finding a hidden creature or recalling an obscure bit of knowledge, you ight have to attempt a die roll to determine if your Seek power was successful. This die roll is usually an Intellect roll, such as an Intellect+Notice roll to spot a hidden creature or an Intellect+Society roll to recall information about a culture.                                   Shove                                                                           You push a creature away from you                                 Attack              Wrestling                                Target         One creature you can reach                  Make a Strength attack roll against the higher of your target’s Strength DC or Agility DC.      Critical Success   You push your target up to 10 feet away from you   Success   You push your target back 5 feet                                   Stand                                                                           You stand up, and are no longer prone                                 Move                                Requirements         You are prone                  You stand up so that you are no longer prone.                                   Stride                                                                           You move from one location to another                                 Move               Move a distance up to your Speed. If you move across extremely difficult or hazardous terrain, the GM might ask you make a die roll to determine if your Stride power was successful.                                   Strike                                                                           You attack a target with a weapon                                 Attack                                Target         One creature within your reach (for a melee attack) or within your weapon’s range (for a ranged attack)                  Make an attack roll against the target’s Defense. The attack roll is a Strength roll for melee weapons or an Agility roll for ranged weapons. Weapons with the Finesse trait let you choose either Strength or Agility for the attack roll.   When you make a ranged Strike, you can optionally choose to make a long-range Strike to try to hit a distant target. If you do, you have disadvantage on the attack roll, but your Strike has double the range.      Critical Success   You deal damage equal to 2 * the weapon’s base damage + the attack roll’s attribute   Success   You deal damage equal to the weapon’s base damage + the attack roll’s attribute                                   Sustain                                                                           You concentrate on a spell, extending its duration                                 Concentrate                                Requirements         You have at least one spell active with a sustained duration                  Choose one spell with a sustained duration you have in effect. The duration of that spell continues until the end of your next turn. Some spells might have slightly different or expanded effects if you sustain them. If your Sustain power is disrupted, the spell immediately ends.   If the spell you sustain has the Attack trait, you must repeat the attack roll. Apply the result of this attack roll as if you had cast the spell again. If you get a Failure on this roll, you cannot sustain this spell again. The spell still continues until the end of your next turn.

        "title": "Basic Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are some common rules for the game.   Die Rolls   When you attempt a task that has a chance of failing, you roll dice to determine if your attempt succeeds or fails. All die rolls are associated one stat, called the bonus of the die roll. This stat is usually an attribute or a skill, but can be any number. The die roll is usually referred to by this bonus: if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Strength attribute, then it’s called a Strength roll, or if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Stealth skill, then it’s called a Stealth roll.   To make the die roll, roll 1d20 and add the bonus, and note the result. Your result measures how effectively you attempt the task. Compare this value to the DC set by the GM, using the table below. If you roll a 20 on the die, then your result is one level of success higher than it would normally be. If you roll a 1 on the die, then your result is one level of success lower than it would normally be.   Levels of Success          Result     Values     Description           Critical Success     DC + 10 or more     An exceptionally good result, with bonus positive effects           Success     DC + 0 ... DC + 9     You succeed at the task you were attempting           Failure     DC - 10 ... DC - 1     You fail at the task you were attempting           Critical Failure     DC - 11 or less     An exceptionally bad result, with possible negative effects      Difficulty Classes   The DC (Difficulty Class) of a die roll is usually determined by the GM based on how hard the task seems. The GM is encouraged to used the table below to help them decide the DC. Some abilities call for a die roll against a specific DC. For example, the Strike power calls for a die roll where the DC is your target’s Defense stat.   Sample Difficulties          Difficulty     DC     Description           Simple     10     Something a normal person could do with some effort           Average     15     A task a skilled professional could struggle with           Hard     20     Requires significant training to accomplish           Very Hard     25     Very difficult even for a skilled professional           Extremely Hard     30     Almost impossible except for the greatest masters alive           Impossible     40     At the edge of human achievement, never been done before      Advantage, Disadvantage, and Rerolls   Some effects can give you advantage or disadvantage on a die roll, representing a minor cicumstantial bonus or penalty. When you have advantage on a die roll, you roll the d20 twice and take the higher value. When you have disadvantage on a die roll, you roll the d20 twice and take the lower value. If you have both advantage and disadvantage on a die roll, you only roll the d20 once.   Some effects let you reroll a die roll after it’s made. When you do, repeat the exact same die roll, with the same bonuses, penalties, advantage, and disadvantage as the original. Then, you can pick whether to use the original die roll or the new one.   Turns in Combat   Characters take turns during combat, as who acts first can be very important. When a fight breaks out, everyone involved makes an Initiative roll. Whoever gets the highest result takes the first turn. On your turn, you can use one  power and any number of  powers. You can’t use the same  power more than once on the same turn.   At the end of your turn, you pick who takes the next turn, ally or enemy. If you attacked a creature, that creature can choose to Interrupt your choice and take the next turn instead. No matter what, no one can take multiple turns in the same round. The round ends once everyone has taken a turn. The person who took the last turn in the round chooses who starts the next round. If you took the last turn in a round, you can choose yourself to go first the next round.   Attacks   Some powers represent offensive effects designed to hurt or impede enemies. These are called Attack powers, or just attacks for short. Attacks always involve a die roll, called the attack roll. The attacker makes the the attack roll only once, no matter how many targets the attack has. The attack roll specifies which of the target’s stat to use as the DC, usually Defense or an attribute DC. Since each target can have a different value for this DC, an attack can hit one target but miss another.   For example, the Strike power is an attack. Imagine that Alice uses the Strike power, slashing at Bob with a sword. Alice makes a Strength attack roll against Bob’s Defense. If the result of Alice’s attack roll is equal to or higher than Bob’s Defense score, then Alice’s attack is a success, and deals damage as described in the Strike power.",

Ask your GM what character level you’re starting at, and if they’re using any custom rules. Finally, grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make.   Quick Reference      Reference Tables     You can’t use attribute boosts to increase your score in any attribute above the maximum given below.

Attribute. Your character has four attributes: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Spirit. You add one of these whenever you make a die roll.   Attribute Boost. An attribute boost increases your score in one attribute by 1. You can’t pick an attribute boost that increases your score in an attribute above the maximum given in the table to the right.   Class. A class is a group of thematically similar abilities. Characters are primarily defined by their classes.   Feat. Feats are powerful abilities that don’t come from a class. There are four types of feats: General, Ancestry, Combat, and Skill. Some abilities ask you to pick a feat of a specific type.   Proficiency. Proficiencies are specific topics that people might know a lot about. Proficiencies do nothing on their own, they just help describe your character’s knowledge.   Ribbons. Ribbons are minor abilities that come from a class. Ribbons are usually more useful for roleplay than combat.   Skill. A skill is a broad activity that characters can be good at. When you make a die roll related to a skill’s activity, you add your bonus to the skill (in addition to the attribute).   Skill Boost. A skill boost gives you a +2 bonus whenever you make a die roll with a particular skill. If you have multiple skill boosts for the same skill, add the +2 for each of them, up to the maximum given in the table to the right.   Talent. Talents are powerful abilities that come from a class. Each talent has a tier (Novice/Veteran/Master/Epic). To learn a talent of a tier higher than Novice, you must have at least a required character level and level in the talent’s class, as given in the table to the right.   Pick an Ancestry   An ancestry is a character’s species and culture. Your ancestry gives you several basic abilities (which are shared by all characters of that ancestry), and it lets you pick ancestry feats corresponding to that ancestry.     Pick an ancestry.   Note the starting values of your attributes.   Note your Speed and Size stats.   Note your traits. Some effects work differently on creatures with certain traits.   Read each of the basic abilities given by your ancestry.   If an ability asks you to pick a ribbon, pick a ribbon from the given class.   If an ability asks you to pick an ancestry feat, pick a feat from the list at the bottom of the ancestry’s page.   Pick Two Backgrounds   Backgrounds are a character’s past or current professions, other than adventuring. Each background gives you a skill feat and three proficiencies.     Pick two backgrounds.   For each, pick a skill feat for the given skill. Note the skill boost given by each feat.   For each, note the proficiencies given by the background.   Your life experience also gives you a basic familiarity with several skills and weapons.     Pick four attribute boosts.   Pick two skill feats. Note the skill boost given by each feat.   Pick two combat feats.   Pick a lore proficiency for a specific settlement or terrain you lived in.   Pick a proficiency related to a personal hobby your character enjoys.   Optionally, you can pick an attribute flaw, decreasing one of your attributes to increase another. If you choose to have an attribute flaw:     Decrease your score in one attribute by 1.   Pick an attribute boost.   Make sure that one of your aspects (see the last section on this page) describes the attribute you decreased.   Level Up   For each character level, you pick a level in one class, which gives you one talent from that class. As your character levels up, you also gain other bonuses, depending on whether it’s an odd level or an even level.   For each odd level (1/3/5/etc.):     Pick a class to gain a level in.   Pick a talent from that class.   Pick a feat. If this feat is a skill feat, note the skill boost given by the feat.   Pick a ribbon. This ribbon can be from any class you have at least one level in.   For each even level (2/4/6/etc.):     Pick a class to gain a level in.   Pick a talent from that class.   Pick an attribute boost.   Pick a skill boost.   Pick a Mystic Origin (Spellcasters Only)   The following section only applies to spellcasters. Your character is a spellcaster if you know any spell (a power with the Spell trait). Spells are common in the Mage and Priest classes, and some combat feats are spells. See the spell rules page for details.   If you are a spellcaster, you need to pick a mystic origin, which describes the source of your magic power. Also, your Caster Level is defined as your total level in all Mage or Priest classes.     Pick a mystic origin.   Note your Magic stat, which is either Intellect or Spirit. You add this attribute whenever you make a Magic roll.   Calculate your Mana stat. This is usually equal to 4 + 2 * Caster Level, depending on your mystic origin.   Calculate your Mana Limit stat. This is equal to 1 + half Caster Level.   Note when you replenish your mana. This is usually when you complete an 8-hour rest, depending on your mystic origin.   Read your mystic origin’s special ability.   Pick your Equipment   Your equipment is all the items you own. For adventuers, your most important equipment is the apparel you wear as protection and the weapons you wield in combat.     Start with 10gp for each character level.   Buy your apparel. To maximize your Defense stat, you may want to buy apparel that corresponds to your highest attribute.   Buy your weapons. If you have a combat feat for a weapon, you may want to buy that weapon.   Buy any miscellaneous items you want.   Calculate your Final Stats   Write down all the following values on your character sheet:     For each attribute, calculate your DC in that attribute. This is 10 + your score in that attribute.   Calculate your Health stat. This is 10 + 5 * Character Level + 5 * Strength.   Calculate your Defense stat. This is given by the apparel you’re currently wearing.   Note all the Shields or Weaknesses you have, if any.   Describe your Personality   An aspect is a 2-5 word phrase that describes part of your character’s personality. Aspects act as a roleplay guide that help you develop your character. Write down the following aspects:     Concept: a broad description of your character’s personality   Trouble: something that gets your character into trouble   Relationship: a bond with another character or organization   If you chose an attribute flaw, an aspect describing the flaw   As many additional aspects as you want, up to a maximum of 10   Writing down more aspects is always better. Detailed aspects both help flesh out your character and give you more options to use Setbacks.   Finally, tell the GM your character’s backstory.",

        "title": "Combat Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to combat. See the All Powers page for a list of common actions you can take in combat.   Power Properties   Some powers have a range in feet. If the power doesn’t list a target or an area, it targets one creature you can see within range.   Some powers have an area. If the power lists a range, the area is centered on a point you can see within range, otherwise the area is centered on you. If the power doesn’t list a target, it targets all creatures in the area.   Some powers have a duration. When the duration ends, the power’s effect completely ends. The world returns to its normal state, as if the power hadn’t been used. Any permanent changes the power made to the world, such as inflicting or healing damage, don’t disappear when the power ends. You can’t end an ongoing power early unless it specifies that in its duration.   Visibility   When you try to fight while you can’t see very well, you take penalties based on how badly you can see.           Visibility     Examples     Penalties           Normal     A sunny day, a well-lit room, the area near a torch     None           Poor     Dawn or dusk, a light fog, the area near a single candle            You have:                 Disadvantage on Notice rolls                       Terrible     Nighttime, a very heavy fog, the dazzled condition            You have all of the above, plus:                 Disadvantage on attacks                       No Vision     A lightless space, dense smoke, the blinded condition            You have all of the above, plus:                 You critically fail Notice rolls that rely on sight         You are flat-footed                  Surprise   If you start combat with a creature that isn’t prepared for an imminent attack, that creature is surprised for the first round of combat. Creatures that are surprised don’t roll initiative, are flat-footed, and can’t use  powers.   Falling   If there is nothing supporting your character, you fall. You fall up to 500 feet each round. When you fall 10 or more feet, you take 1d6 damage for each 10 feet, up to a cap of 50d6 damage at 500 feet. The number of dice is reduced by half if you fall onto a soft surface, such as a pile of hay or a pool of water. You land prone if you take any damage from a fall.   Cover   Some environmental features, such as battlements or arrow slits, make it much harder for creatures to hit you with attacks. At the GM’s discretion, these environmental features may give you cover from enemies. In general, you have cover from an enemy if at least 3/4 of your body is blocked by a solid object. If you have cover from an enemy, you have a +5 bonus to Defense against their attacks.   Health   All characters have a Health pool that represents how healthy they currently are. Your Health pool stores a number of points, up to a maximum of your Health stat. When you take damage, you must subtract the damage taken from your Health pool. When you heal, you add the points healed to your Health pool. Your Health pool can never go below 0. While your Health pool is 0, you are downed. When you fall to 0 health, or when you take damage while at 0 health, you gain 1 fatigue.   Fatigue   All characters have a Fatigue track that represents how tired, drained, and unhealthy they currently are. Your Fatigue track stores a number of fatigue points, up to a maximum of 5 fatigue. You start at 0 fatigue. While you are at 3 or more fatigue, you are slowed. While you are at 4 or more fatigue, you have disadvantage on all rolls. While you are at 5 fatigue, you are unconscious.   Dying   You die if you’re at 0 health and 5 fatigue. Try to not die.",

You are flat-footed, and you have disadvantage on Notice rolls and attack rolls.   Bloodied  You are significantly injured. You have the bloodied condition whenever you at at half Health or below.   Dazzled  Your eyes are overstimulated. You have disadvantage on Notice rolls and attack rolls.   Downed  You are severely injured and are barely able to move. You are incapacitated, prone, and slowed, and you cannot stand up.   Flat-footed  You’re distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. Attack rolls against you have advantage.   Grabbed  You’re held in place by another creature, and you are flat-footed and immobilized.   Immobilized  You can’t use any power with the Move trait. If you’re immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a die roll against the DC of the effect holding you.   Incapacitated  You are unable to fight. You can’t use any  or  powers.   Prone  You’re lying on the ground. You are flat-footed and have disadvantage on attack rolls. The only Move powers you can use are Stand and Stride, and you can only move by crawling, which is normally at half Speed. You have cover from enemies more than 20 feet from you.   Restrained  You’re tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You are flat-footed and immobilized, and you can’t use any powers with the Attack or Manipulate traits except the Escape power.   Slowed  Your speed is halved.   Stunned  You’ve become senseless. You are flat-footed and can’t use any powers.   Taunted  You are entirely focused on an enemy. Whenever you make an attack, you must target that enemy if possible. In addition, you cannot use Move powers to move away from that enemy. If you are taunted by a new enemy, you are no longer taunted by the previous enemy.   Terrified  You are overcome with terror. On each of your turns, you must use the Stride power and the Repeat (Stride) power to move as far away as possible from the source of your terror. This effect doesn’t force you to move through obviously dangerous terrain. You has disadvantage on all rolls while you can see the source of your terror.   Unconscious  You’re sleeping, or you’ve been knocked out. You have the blinded, prone, and stunned conditions.",

Specify the kinds of experiences you’re trying to learn or share. For example, you could choose to share memories of a certain event, current experiences of emotions, or thoughts on philosophy. The GM determines which exact experiences of this type are shared.   Make an Intellect attack roll against your target’s Intellect DC. (As with all rolls, you can choose to automatically fail or critically fail this roll.)

Creatures within 60 feet can speak telepathically with you by focusing on a phrase to send.   By replacing normal speech with telepathy, you can remove the Auditory trait from powers you use.         Some telepaths are so used to mental conversation that they forget how to speak normally.

At the end of each of your turns, you take 1d6 damage. If this damage is completely negated (such as by any Fire Shield you have), this power immediately ends.

This Strike deals 1d6 Piercing base damage, and it deals an extra 20 damage against inanimate objects.   You can efficiently tunnel through walls by repeatedly using this power. As a rough estimate, in one minute of work, you can tunnel through 1 foot of soft material (dirt, sand, plaster) or a few inches of hard material (wood, loose stones, old masonry). You can’t tunnel through materials you can’t damage, such as solid stone or metal.

The GM assigns a DC for this claim based on how extreme it is: a reasonble claim would be DC 5-10, a very unusual one might be DC 15, while a crazy or impossible claim would be DC 20 or more. The GM and the player should agree on the DC. Then, the GM rolls a d20 in secret. If this d20 meets or exceeds the DC, then the claim is actually true, otherwise, the claim is actually false.

For example, you have a +10 bonus to Agility+Stealth rolls to sneak through an army camp by wearing a military uniform. As another example, you have a +10 bonus to Intellect+Eloquence rolls to forge a letter supposedly from a minor administrator in a large guild.

You learn your target’s location, the general content of their prayer, and their current emotions. You can choose to send vague emotions to your target in reply.

While in combat, you cannot be disarmed of your clan axe. You can show your clan axe to other orcs as a sign of social status, giving you advantage on Spirit rolls to interact with other orcs (except orcs who dislike your clan).   If you ever lose your clan axe, you always somehow find it again the next day, even if your clan axe was seemingly stolen or destroyed. If you sell or willingly give up your clan axe, you permanently lose this power.

Some orcish youths play a uniquely dangerous game: jump off the highest point you can find, then activate this feat as you hit the ground.

This changes numerical penalties into bonuses and changes disadvantage into advantage. If the GM was increasing the DC of the roll because of the harsh terrain or weather, the GM should instead decrease the DC of the roll by the same amount.   For example, if you make an Intellect+Travel roll to track a creature through a blizzard, the DC of the roll would normally be extremely high, maybe +10 above normal. If you use this power, the DC of the roll is instead -10 less than normal.

If you die while your phylactery is intact, you can use the Reshape Form ability to form a new body around your phylactery and revive yourself. If your phylactery is destroyed, you die.   Your phylactery can be any item: an article of clothing, a weapon, a holy symbol, or so on. You must always stay nearby your phylactery. At the end of each of your turns, if you are more than 30 feet away from your phylactery, you take 10d6 Necrotic damage.

The detached body part moves 5 feet towards your body, stopping if it hits a solid object.                                      Duration         1 hour, until the body part falls to 0 health, or until you reattach the part                  Choose one body part, such as a hand, an eye, or so on. This body part detaches from the rest of your body, falling to the ground. While detached, the body part continues to function normally: eyes can still see, fingers can still move, and your head can still send orders to the rest of your body. Your body part has 10 Defense and 10 Health.   Losing body parts limits what your normal body can do. If you detach a hand or arm, you can’t wield items in that hand. If you detach a leg or foot, you are slowed. If you detach both your eyes, you can’t see from your normal body. If your body part is detached when this power ends, you permanently lose that body part. You regenerate lost body parts over the course of 1 week.   You instinctively know the distance and direction to all your detached body parts. You can use the Recall Body Part power.   For example, you could detach your eye and roll it beneath a door to watch events on the other side. You could split your body into a number of small pieces to cram into a tight space. You could detach your hand to have it crawl towards someone to creep them out.

If you end your Stride inside of a solid object, you take 2d6 Force damage and are ejected to the nearest empty space.

This power does not show constructs, outsiders, undead, or other creatures without biological processes.                                                   No Vital Organs                                                         You take reduced damage from critical hits since you have no weak points                  When a Physical attack critically succeeds against you, you take damage as if that attack had only been a success.

The size of the area changes according to the following rule: burst sizes, cone sizes, and line sizes are proportional like 2, 3, and 4. For example, you could change a 10-foot burst to a 15-foot cone or a 20-foot line.   If you reshape a cone or line without a range into a burst, then the new area is an emanation instead of a burst.

In addition, you know exactly where you can go or who you can ask to learn the information.   The GM determines where or from whom the information could be accessed. If the information is a great secret, the GM could make the place or person with the information be almost completely inaccessible. Information on magic is commonly found at libraries, archives, univeristies, magic shops, and with the people who work in those locations.   For example, imagine you roll Intellect+Arcana to identify a magical ward around a noble’s house. The GM knows that the ward sends the caster a magical ping if anyone breaks into the house. If you fail the roll, you don’t learn this, but might instead learn that the ward is intended as a deterent against burglars. You might also learn that Alice the Artificer, who runs a shop down the street, would be able to easily identify the true nature of the ward if she had a chance to analyze it.

You and creatures you tell about this weakness can target it instead of targeting the structure as a whole. The weakness has health much less than the original structure, usually 1/10 of the original health, though the GM may change this value. If you destroy the weakness, the entire structure collapses.         The target area is only two meters wide. It’s a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.                                              Crazy Prepared                                                                           You always have exactly the right item prepared for a task                                 Daily              Retroactive                                Skill boost         Crafting                  You reveal an item you constructed in the past, and use the Interact power to draw this item from somewhere you have been storing it. You must have reasonably been able to craft this item in the past 24 hours.   For example, if you’re delving a dungeon, you could pull out a crowbar and reveal you forged one earlier at the local smithy. Alternatively, if you’re preparing a meal for a lord, you could reveal that you had already made the lord’s favorite food. The GM has final say on whether any item is reasonable.         And here’s one I prepared earlier…                                              Jury Rig                                                                           You instantly craft a crude, fragile item out of common scrap parts                                   Skill boost         Crafting              Duration         10 minutes                  You build a non-magical, handheld item of your choice out of scrap parts lying around nearby. This item is of very low quality, so it has the Fragile trait, and it permanently breaks when the duration ends.                                                   Mouse Trap                                                         You can disguise traps or machines as collections of seemingly unrelated parts                                   Skill boost         Crafting                  Whenever you set a mechanical trap or build a large device, you can disguise the mechanism as a set of completely mundane objects, which you placed to perfectly trigger a cascading effect. Anyone casually searching the area never realizes the mundane objects have any mechanical effect. Someone who is determinedly searching the area for traps or devices has a -10 penalty to any rolls made to detect the mechanism.                                                   Quick Craft                                                                           You complete a long crafting job with a flurry of activity                                 Encounter                                Skill boost         Crafting              Duration         1 minute                  You craft at 60 times your normal speed. This means that over the next minute, you can complete the same amount of work you would normally complete in an hour.

If you could not have reasonably obtained this invitation, you instead reveal a convincing forgery.   If a person checking this invitation is not suspicious of you, they will likely give you access to the restricted area or event. This invitation easily holds against all casual scrutiny, but a determined check could reveal it as fabricated.

Critical Success   Your target is stunned   Success   Your target has disadvantage on all rolls   Critical Failure   You have disadvantage on all rolls   If you succeed or critically succeed on this power, your argument might succeed in permanently persuading your target of the truth of your claim.

Success   Your target appears at a location of your choice   Failure   Your target appears at a random safe location   Critical Failure   Your target appears at a random dangerous location   Whatever your result, your targets all appear at the same location in the spirit world.

Your character states the rule out loud, explaining its importance to the faith and its origins as a belief. This rule is retroactively one of the core beliefs of your character’s religion. If past events in the campaign contradict this rule, then the rule isn’t very important to the average practicioner of your religion.   From now on, all believers in your character’s religion publicly follow the declared rule. Breaking the rule is considered a terrible taboo. If your character breaks the declared rule, your character will lose reputation with other practicioners of their religion.                                                   Divine Sense                                                         You can sense powerful spirits, like kami, outsiders, and undead                                 Divination                                Skill boost         Religion                  You have a special sense that lets you detect spirits. This sense is similar to a normal human’s sense of smell: spirits constantly emanate a vague aura, and this aura sticks to locations they’ve spent a lot of time at. You can distinguish between different types of spirits by the “smell” of this aura. An unkept graveyard might have a strong smell of undeath, while a church run by a kami might smell vaguely of Heaven.

Followers of that religion generally respect your moral and religious authority.                                                   Secret Cult                                                         You are a member of a secret religous cult with members hidden everywhere                                   Skill boost         Religion                  You are a member of a secret society or a religious cult with significant influence. The cult has members almost everywhere in the world, and cultists can identify each other with a secret sign. You can ask for favors from other cultists, and other cultists may ask favors from you. If you repeatedly refuse to help other cultists or act against the cult’s goals, you may be declared an enemy of the cult.

This figure has heard of you before and is friendly towards you. You can get an audience with them and can ask them for minor favors.

This retroactively becomes fact. Your declaration should be entirely about events that are years in the past, and should not focus on the current state of affairs.   For example, you could state that two nations recently emerged from a brutal war, so there’s lingering resentment between the two peoples. Alternatively, you could declare that a city built an elaborate series of underground catacombs a century ago, and those catacombs are still around to this day.

You must have observed a moderate amount of this language within the last 24 hours: at least 1 minute of speech, 1 page of writing, or the equivalent for other forms of communication. You instantly learn to speak or write this language at the level of a young child. You are not proficient enough in this language to communicate complex ideas.

Just a Box                                                         You are an expert at hiding behind immobile objects, even in the strangest spots                                   Skill boost         Stealth                  You are an expert at placing inanimate objects in the perfect locations. Whenever you hide behind or inside of an inanimate, immobile object, you can slightly adjust this object to perfectly blend into its surroundings. Even if the object would normally be wildly out of place, no one notices the object is strange in any way. This effect ends if the object moves, if the object is a threat or obstacle, or if you are no longer hidden behind or inside of the object.   For example, you can hide inside of a box in the middle of the floor, and no one will question why the box is there so long as it stays still. You can hide behind a tall potted plant next to a lava lake in the middle of an evil dungeon, and no one will question the plant’s existence.

This doesn’t apply to creatures that are actively searching the area, that are on guard for danger, or that already know you’re here.

If you end your Stride in direct view, you are seen as normal.

Additionally, you notice a hidden bit of information of the DM’s choice about the creatures you’re tracking. For example, you might notice that the creatures are walking single-file to hide their numbers, that the tracks match a specific style of boot, or that the creatures were moving with unusual haste.

This feature must match the general terrain: you could find a nearby creek if you’re in a forest, but not if you’re in a desert. The feature is fairly close by, maybe 30 minutes of travel outdoors, or 5 minutes of travel in a city.   For example, if you’re in a hilly mountain, you could find a nearby cave, cliff, or ravine. Alternatively, if you’re in a dense city, you could find a nearby tavern, guard barracks, or temple.

        "excerpt": "Hello, and welcome to the core rulebook of Forge of Power! I assume that if you’re reading this, you’re already familiar with tabletop RPGs, like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, or Shadowrun. After years of playing these games, I found rules that I wanted to change, new mechanics I wanted to introduce, and interesting ideas I wanted to combine. The result was this system, Forge of Power, that takes all my favorite mechanics from across many systems and merges them together. I think the whole has become more than the sum of its parts.   Versatile Character Creation   Forge of Power tries to maximize the number of options available in character creation. Unlike D&amp;D or Pathfinder, characters in Forge of Power do not choose a single class that determines what your character does. Instead, whenever a character levels up, they can choose a talent, a special ability that makes the character much stronger in one way. Talents are organized by theme into collections of related talents, called classes. Characters are free to mix and match talents from different classes, letting you pick the perfect combination of talents to realize your character’s theme.   To expand your options even further, classes have minor abilities called ribbons, which make characters more flavorful or thematic, without greatly affecting your combat power. Ribbons separate out combat strength from roleplaying abilities, making it so every character always has unique strengths to offer both in combat and in social interactions.   Tactical Combat   Like many other roleplaying games, Forge of Power puts a heavy emphasis on combat. The game rules try to make combat as interesting as possible for all characters. All characters, magical and martial, have access to the same number of powers. This means that the fighter will have just as many interesting options to use in combat as the wizard. A lot of effort has been spent trying to balance the various powers against each other. No strategy in combat should ever clearly be much stronger than another.   Setting   Forge of Power was designed around a medieval fantasy world, just like D&amp;D or Pathfinder. Players can expect a setting where brave paladins fight against cunning devils, elven wizards duel against ancient dragons, and adventurers regularly delve into dungeons to slay monsters and recover hidden treasures. That said, the game rules never assume the game uses a specific setting, and groups can play this system in a universe of their choice. Forge of Power can be adapted to completely different settings with only minor modifications. Running a futuristic sci-fi game only requires changing the equipment list to add plasma guns, lightsabers, and spaceships. Running a realistic medieval game is as simple as banning all the “magical” classes.",

        "title": "Narrative Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are rules that help groups play out interesting stories.  ## Aspects  Aspects are short phrases that describe your character's personality. Aspects are usually 2-5 words long, but they can be longer. Aspects have no direct mechanical effect, they're more like a roleplay guide to help you flesh out your character. During a game, you can reference your aspects to help you decide what your character would do.  There are several broad categories of aspects. These categories have no mechanical effect, and aspects don't have to fit into a single category. * **Concept** aspects are overall descriptions of your character's personality. They can represent your character's class or archetype, your profession, or your driving motives. * **Trouble** aspects are traits that can get your character into trouble. They can represent personality flaws, driven enemies, or just bad luck. Trouble aspects are especially useful for Setbacks. * **Relationship** aspects are emotional bonds between your character and other people in the game world. They can represent friendships, a role in an organization, or a personal idol.  ## Quests  The game is divided into **quests**, each of which has a single well-defined objective. Each quest has a current **Challenge** score, which usually starts at 1. When the party completes a quest, everyone gains XP equal to the quest’s Challenge score. A player character levels up whenever they reach a multiple of 10 XP.  Whenever the GM adds a complication to the quest, they should increase the Challenge by 1. Especially deadly complications might increase the Challenge by 2 or more.  The party can vote to spend 1 Challenge point to introduce a reasonable plot point that makes the quest easier, such as calling in allies to help, or adding a lucky coincidence that works in their favor. The GM determines whether a proposed plot point would be reasonable. Introducing a plot point can only trivialize the quest if it reduces the Challenge to 0.  ## Inspiration  Every player has a pool of **inspiration** points that they can spend to influence the story. You can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any die roll that any character makes. When you do, you must explain how your character somehow influences the roll. Even just yelling a few words of moral support counts.  You start every session with 1 inspiration point. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration. You can also earn inspiration through Setbacks (see below). Unspent inspiration goes away at the end of a session.  ## Setbacks  In books, movies, and shows, we constantly see characters act against their best interests. This makes for interesting, realistic stories of complex, flawed characters. These self-imposed setbacks often act to reinforce the theme of a story. A comedy show relies on exagerrated, silly characters who make humorous mistakes. A grim drama relies on characters with emotional scars that flare up at the worst times.  Forge of Power encourages these stories by compensating players for in-character setbacks. At any time, a player can propose a **Setback**, explaining how a character might act in a way that makes the current quest harder for the entire party. The proposed action has to match the game's theme: if you're running a comedic game, the Setback must be humorous, or if you're running a grimdark game, the Setback must be dark or hurtful. The proposed action must also directly relate to one of the character's aspects.  The player who controls the character (or the GM, if the character is an NPC) can then choose to accept or reject the proposed Setback. If they accept the Setback, then the proposed action occurs in the game. Both the player who proposed the Setback and the player controlling the character gain 1 inspiration (if you Setback your own character, you gain 2 inspiration). The current quest's Challenge score increases by 1.  Setbacks have a few limitations: * First, many Setbacks require an in-character action that can be blocked by other characters. For example, if the reckless character tries to charge into a fight, their party might grab them before they run off. If the action is blocked by other characters, the Setback is cancelled. * Second, the same character can't cause a Setback twice in a row. (The same player *can* propose two Setbacks in a row, if they want.) * Third, you can't Setback the same aspect twice in the same game session.",

        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to spells.  ## Casting Spells  A power with the [[Spell]] trait is called a **spell**. Using such a power is called **casting** the spell. Casting a spell requires speaking a command phrase and making hand gestures, which usually make it obvious that you are casting a spell. All spells implicitly have the [[Concentrate]] and [[Manipulate]] traits.  Casting spells requires an **arcane focus**, which is a handheld item you use to channel your magic. You can meditate or focus for 1 hour to designate an item as your arcane focus. Bonding to a new arcane focus severs your connection with your previous focus. You can pick any item as your arcane focus - a staff, a book, a crystal gem, a sword, or so on. You must hold your arcane focus in one hand while casting a spell or using the {Sustain} power.  ## Mana  All characters that can cast spells have a Mana pool that represents how much magical energy they have available. Your Mana pool stores a number of points, up to a maximum of your Mana stat. When you pay Mana to cast a spell, you must subtract the amount paid from your Mana pool. Your Mana pool can never go below 0. Your [mystic origin](mystic-origins.html) determines your Mana stat and describes when your Mana pool replenishes.  All spells have a **cost** in Mana. You must pay this amount of Mana when you cast the spell. If you don't have enough Mana, you can't cast the spell. Some effects increase or decrease the base cost of a spell, as described in the next section.  ## Heightening and Cost Reductions  You can **heighten** some spells to increase their effect, at the cost of paying more Mana to use the spell. Spells that can be heightened will have a ***Heightened*** block beneath the spell's text, which describes the ways you can heighten the spell. When you heighten a spell, you cannot increase the final cost above your character's **Mana Limit** stat. Your Mana Limit stat is given by your [mystic origin](mystic-origins.html).  Some effects reduce the cost of a spell. This decreases the amount of mana you have to spend on the spell, but doesn't reduce the effect of the spell. You must always spend at least 1 Mana when you cast a spell, or at least 0 Mana if the spell has the [[Cantrip]] trait.  Some effects depend on the exact cost of a spell. This is measured in two ways. The **cost** of a spell is the amount of Mana you pay to cast it. The cost of a spell includes both heightening the spell and any effects the reduce the cost. The **power** of a spell is the effectiveness of the spell. The power of a spell includes heightening the spell, but *does not* include any effects that reduce the cost.  ## Customizing Spells  Spells are flexible effects, and the caster has significant leeway in choosing how the spell is expressed. A powerful spellcaster who conjures vast firestorms could use that same spell to light a single candle. You can reduce the area, range, duration, or damage of a spell as much as you want when you cast the spell, though the cost stays the same. Ask your GM what other parameters you can change for a given spell. Once you cast the spell, you no longer have direct control over the magic, so you have to pick any changes when you cast the spell.  Players are encouraged to describe their spells differently than how they're described in the rules. For example, instead of describing your {Invoke Blast} spell as an explosion of flames, you could describe it as a flash of lightning, an intense wave of radiation, or as briefly transporting targets to a Hell dimension. Your unique description for your spell is called the spell's Trappings.  Trappings shouldn't change how a spell functions in normal circumstances. The GM might say that Trappings change how a spell acts in unusual circumstances, such as a flash of lightning being more effective than a fireball when the target is underwater. Creatively using spells is cool, and should be encouraged.",

You can see, hear, and smell illusions, but you cannot touch them. Some illusions, called tangible illusions, are solid and can be touched. All illusions can perform small natural animations, such as grass waving in the wind, water flowing in a creek, or a person breathing.   Physical interaction with the illusion reveals it as fake, because things can pass through it. You can also investigate an illusion with the Seek power: if you succeed on an Intellect+Notice roll against the Magic DC of the illusion’s creator, you realize the illusion is fake. Even if you know something is an illusion, it still affects your senses normally.

        "excerpt": "Berserkers are aggressive melee fighters who believe that the best defense is a good offense. They charge into enemy lines, lay waste to their opponents, and refuse to give up and die. Berserkers are notoriously angry, and are adept at channeling their rage into combat power.   Berserker talents give amazing boosts to melee damage. Some of their talents help them resist damage, but others lower their own defense in exchange for damage. Some berserker talents let them resist death or heal when they attack others. Berserker ribbons offer a variety of social and utility effects.   Examples of berserkers in fiction include Conan the Barbarian, the Hulk from Marvel Comics, and most fictional viking warriors.

Many duelists come from noble or gladiatorial backgrounds, where skill and elegance in combat are highly valued. Duelists most often wield swords.   Duelist talents focus on accurate attacks and impenetrable defenses.

They fight in the front lines as vanguards who distract attention from their more vulnerable allies. Many guardians are altruistic and supportive fighters who focus on defending others before themselves.   Guardian talents greatly increase defense against all attacks and spells. Many guardian talents distract enemies from your allies and force them to attack only you instead. Guardian ribbons increase resilience against environment effects or boost your reputation as a knight.

Swordsages’ supernatural abilities come from their innate ki powers, which they might have unlocked through years of meditation and training.

Their talents might create mirages of multiple attacks, turn the swordsage incorporeal as they dodge, or shape their ki into solid objects. Swordsage ribbons use ki for minor utility effects.

        "excerpt": "Warblades are specialist fighters who develop a unique personal fighting style. Every warblade is completely different from every other warblade, as they all develop distinct and specialized weapons and fighting styles. Warblades usually trained at small esoteric martial arts schools with few practitioners.   Warblade talents use weapons for unique or customizable martial maneuvers. Warblades can specialize in any combination of offense, defense, and utility, depending on what maneuvers they choose. Warblade ribbons represent unique or strange skills associated with their particular fighting style.   Examples of warblades in fiction include almost all anime fighters that have unique or strange fighting styles, as well as almost all characters from classic arcade fighting games.

        "excerpt": "Acrobats are agile combatants who leap and dodge between attacks. They move through the front line with ease, dodging enemy attacks and retaliating with speed and precision. Acrobats are known for their supernatural abilities to move on difficult terrain, running up walls, along water, or even walking on thin air.   Acrobat talents focus on movement and dodging attacks. The majority of acrobat talents are defensive, though a few give opportunities to disorient enemies or counterattack. Some acrobat talents combine movement and combat, giving stat bonuses for using the environment to your advantage. Acrobat talents give even more ways to move around the world.   Examples of acrobats in fiction include Ty Lee from Avatar: The Last Airbender, Spiderman from Marvel Comics, all the protagonists of Assassin’s Creed, and most fictional monks and swashbucklers.

If you do not, you fall and your Stride ends.

        "excerpt": "Hunters are ranged warriors who focus on taking down targets with precise, deadly shots. They are unmatched when it comes to chasing and defeating single targets, as enemies can’t flee from their range and accuracy. Most hunters avoid fighting in melee, preferring to use their range to their advantage.   Hunter talents give a variety of boosts to ranged weapons and single-target attacks. Some talents give buffs to single long-range shots with high accuracy and damage, while others give buffs to attacks against specific targets. Hunter ribbons give them bonuses on tracking down enemies and surviving the wilderness.   Examples of hunters in fiction include Hawkeye from Marvel Comics, Ashe from League of Legends, and most fictional rangers or snipers.

        "excerpt": "Inventors are genius engineers who test their gadgets in the field. They design and build a variety of amazing or technologically impossible devices to fight enemies or accomplish tasks. An inventor’s gadgets might include robot minions, prototype firearms, or electrical circuits. Inventors ignore the normal technological level of the setting.   Inventor talents let them create gadgets that perform a variety of utility effects. These include everything from potions that heal injured allies to automatic turrets that attack enemies to grappling hooks to fly around. Inventor ribbons give them even more options for building objects with miscellaneous useful effects.   Examples of inventors in fiction include Iron Man from Marvel Comics, the Engineer from Team Fortress 2, and most fictional scientist or engineer heroes.                    Novice Talents                                      Alchemical Bomb                                                                           You throw an explosive bomb full of unstable chemicals                                 Attack                                Range         60 feet              Area         5-foot burst                  When you use this power, choose one of the Cold, Electricity, Fire, Necrotic, Sonic, or Toxic traits. This power gains that trait.   Make an Intellect attack roll against your target’s Agility DC.      Success   Your target takes 1d12 damage                                                   Brew Elixir                                                                           You craft a potion with a versatile beneficial effect                                 Daily               Choose one of the following types of elixir. You produce two doses of that elixir that you brewed previously. A creature can drink a dose of elixir with the Interact power to gain the effects of the elixir. Each dose loses its magic when you complete an 8-hour rest.   Boldness. The drinker gains +1 to all attacks for 1 minute.   Healing. The drinker heals 2d4 + your Intellect health.   Levitate. The drinker can fly at half Speed for 10 minutes.   Resilience. The drinker gains +1 Defense for 10 minutes.   Swiftness. The drinker gains +10 feet Speed for 1 hour.   Transformation. The drinker’s physical features change for 10 minutes, making them appear as a different person of their choice of roughly the same body shape.                                                   Clockwork Turret                                                                           You construct a turret that can fire its ballista at enemies                        Clockwork Turret Stats                                   Construct              Minion              Unintelligent                                Attributes         Strength +0, Agilty varies, Intellect –, Spirit –              Other stats         Health varies, Defense 15, Speed 0 feet, Size -1                  The clockwork turret can fire its ballista as a crossbow.                                    Concentrate              Manipulate                                Duration         10 minutes, or until you use this power again                  You set up a clockwork turret on a flat surface you can reach. The turret’s Agility equals your Intellect, and the turret’s Health equals 5 times your Inventor level.   When the duration expires, the clockwork turret deactivates and starts to fall apart into a pile of scraps.                                                   Magitech Engine                                                                           You craft a small engine with an elemental effect                Using Magitech Engines   You can configure your magitech engines to output anything related to their element. This makes the engines incredibly versatile parts, useful for any construction project. Be creative!   As always, the GM has the final say as to whether any attempt is reasonable. The GM may ask you to make an Intellect+Crafting roll to determine if a more difficult use of the engines works out.   Examples   You can aim a jet at an enemy you can reach to deal 1 damage to that enemy. You can set up a Cold engine inside of an airtight box to create a portable freezer. You can use an Electricity engine to power electrical devices, or to fill a metal object with static electricity. You can attach a pair of Fire engines to the back of a cart to propel it forward like a rocket. You can set up a Sonic engine to play loud noises you choose, like a powerful speaker. You can trace a Toxic engine over a rock surface to etch words into the surface.                           Concentrate              Manipulate                                Duration         1 minute after the engine is attached to a weapon, or 1 hour otherwise                  You craft a small magic device that outputs a stream of elemental energy. Choose the engine’s element to be one of Cold, Electricity, Fire, Sonic, or Toxic. The engine continually emits small jet of that element. You can set up the engine to perform a minor utility effect related to its element.   When you use this power, or with the Interact power afterwards, you can attach the engine to a weapon you touch. Strikes with that weapon deal an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen trait. A weapon can only have one engine attached to it at a time.                                                   Mutagen                                                                           You give someone a dangerous mutagen that enhances them at a cost                                 Manipulate              Toxic              Transfiguration                                Target         One willing ally you can reach (including yourself)              Duration         10 minutes                  Drinking multiple mutagens in a short time is very dangerous to the body.

Most rogues favor stealth and surprise attacks over direct combat. Rogues have a generally negative reputation as thieves, liars, and assassins.   Rogue talents give many ways to confuse or avoid enemies. They also include ways to exploit a distraction for all it’s worth, with powerful sneak attacks and finishing moves. Rogue talents also let them escape danger through luck or stealth. Rogue ribbons give more ways to sneak around and avoid getting caught.   Examples of rogues in fiction include Han Solo from Star Wars, Batman from DC Comics, Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Carribean, and Corvo Attano from Dishonored.

Whenever you are seemingly killed or disabled, after 1 week or so, the GM should introduce some kind of plot contrivance to let you rejoin the action.

Success   The triggering creatures do not notice you, and cannot perceive you for the rest of your turn   This power lets you Strike without being seen, sneak through an open room with no cover, or otherwise act brazenly while remaining hidden. Since this power only lasts until the end of your turn, you must end your turn in a hiding spot if you want to stay hidden.

Never Tell Me the Odds                                                         You ignore the normal odds and substitute your own                  Whenever you perform an entirely luck-based activity with two possible outcomes, you can choose to ignore the normal odds and instead make it a 50-50 chance either way. If the original chance of the good outcome was much less than 50%, then the GM should add narrative consequences to the good outcome proportional to how unlikely it was.   For example, if you play the lottery, you could choose to have a 50% chance of winning. Since winning the lottery was extremely unlikely, the GM should add severe consequences - maybe a thieves’ guild targets you for your newfound riches, or the local lord tries to throw you in jail and take your winnings.   As another example, if you sail a ship along a random path through dangerous waters, you could choose to have a 50% chance of making it through successfully. Since surviving the trip intact was moderately unlikely, the GM should add moderate consequences - maybe your passing aggravated a nearby sea serpent, or maybe you’re now hopelessly lost.

        "excerpt": "Strategists are leaders who support their team in and out of combat. They might be inspirational warriors who lead from the front, but they can also be noncombatants who lend aid without interfering directly. Strategists are known for their supernatural planning abilities, staying three steps ahead of their enemies at all times.   Strategist talents focus on supporting allies instead of acting directly. Many of these talents give tactical combat bonuses, letting their allies have extra actions, damage, or defense. Strategists have almost no talents that affect only themselves. Strategist ribbons give them the social and tactical abilities they need as leaders.   Examples of strategists in fiction include Princess Leia from Star Wars, Roy from Order of the Stick, and all the protagonists of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure.                    Novice Talents                                      Chessmaster                                                                           You reveal you planned for this exact situation all along!                                 Daily              Retroactive               You announce that you planned this all along! You explain the details of your plan, which retroactively become fact. Your plan must be something that you could have conceivably prepared within the past 24 hours. Your plan cannot involve any actions that would require die rolls to succeed. The GM has final say on whether any plan is reasonable.   For example, if you are investigating a dungeon, you could announce that you remembered to bring 100 feet of rope and a grappling hook, as you had anticipated that you might fall down a chasm.   As another example, if you are in a meeting with the evil mayor, you could announce that you had arranged for the captain of the guard to be wandering by at just the right time, as you had predicted that the mayor would reveal his plan at this exact time.

        "excerpt": "Arcanists are expert mages who specialize in manipulating magical forces in complex ways. They are the most academic and formal casters, and are the best at complex rituals, wards, and enchantments. Arcanists are often found in wizard academies and guardian fortresses, where their skill at defensive warding is put to use.   Arcanist talents give a variety of utility and combat effects, with a focus on defense. These talents give ways to set up wards and runes, dispel other magic effects, and build constructs of magical force. Arcanists have no purely offensive talents. Arcanist ribbons further enhance their knowledge about and ability to manipulate magic.   Examples of arcanists in fiction include the entire cast of Harry Potter, any D&amp;D caster that specializes in abjuration, as well as most fictional academically-trained wizards or mages.                    Novice Talents                                      Arcane Shield                                                                           You conjure a shimmering field of magical force that blocks an attack                                 Force              Spell                                Cost         1 Mana              Trigger         An attack targets your Defense              Duration         Until the start of your next turn                  You gain +5 Defense.

The glyph does nothing until it triggers. When the glyph triggers, the Explosive Runes effect activates.   You choose the conditions that trigger the glyph. For example, you could choose for the glyph to trigger when any creature touches or stands on the surface, when an object covering the glyph is removed, or when a creature reads the glyph. You can also specify more complex conditions, such as only triggering when a creature fails to speak a particular password. If the glyph is damaged, it triggers immediately. If two glyphs are in the same 5-foot space for 1 hour, their magic interferes and both trigger. If the glyph is moved more than 5 feet, it becomes unable to trigger for 1 minute.   Optionally, you can store a different effect in the glyph instead of Explosive Runes. When you cast this spell, also cast another spell of your choice. This other spell doesn’t take effect as normal, but is instead stored inside the glyph. This other spell takes effect when the glyph triggers. You must specify all the parameters of the spell (including its target, any heightening, and so on) when you store it in the glyph.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The damage of the Explosive Runes effect increases by 1d6         I prepared Explosive Runes this morning.

Use your Magic score instead of your Strength score for the attack roll.   If you Grapple a creature, you don’t need to be able to reach them, you aren’t slowed, and you can’t drag them with you when you move. It’s the hand grabbing them, not you.                   Interposing Hand                                                         Range         60 feet              Target         An empty space you can see within range                  The target space is occupied by the hand.

The hand mimics the movements of your own hand, but with extended range and power. You can use the Grasping Hand, Interposing Hand, and Punching Hand powers.   At the GM’s discretion, the hand can perform other useful tasks, such as manipulating objects or carrying items. As a general rule, the hand uses your Magic score instead of Strength or Agility, and it can function out to a range of 60 feet.   Heightened   For each +1 Mana, the range of each power increases by 10 feet, and the damage of Punching Hand increases by 1d6.

When you redirect a spell, you choose the target of the spell instead of the original caster.                                                   Resilient Sphere                                                                           You conjure an indestructible sphere around several creatures                        Rolling Sphere                                                       Move                                Duration         1 minute, or until you use Crashing Sphere                  Choose a direction. At the end of each of your turns, you roll 10 feet in that direction. This movement stacks with further uses of this power: if you use Rolling Sphere 10 times, then you move 100 feet at the end of each of your turns. If this movement would carry you into another creature or a solid object, use the Crashing Sphere effect on that target.

The sphere is translucent, solid, weightless, and completely indestructible. Nothing can pass in or out of the sphere except light. Your target can roll the sphere to move at half Speed, but can’t move normally. Your target can use the Rolling Sphere power.   Make a Magic attack roll against your target’s Agility DC.      Critical Success   This spell lasts 10 minutes   Success   This spell lasts 1 minute   Failure   This spell lasts until the end of your target’s next turn   Critical Failure   This spell ends immediately   Heightened   For each +1 Mana, you can target another creature within range.

Any Novice Arcanist can manually reset a disabled glyph, which lets the glyph trigger again in the future. If the glyph contains Explosive Runes or a spell of cost 0, the glyph automatically resets after 1 hour.   Manually resetting a glyph requires 1 minute of work. If the glyph contains a spell of cost 1 or higher, this work consumes an amount of expensive chalk worth 1 gp times the Mana cost of the spell stored in the glyph.

The wall consists of up to 10 flat, thin square panels, each of which is 10 feet by 10 feet in size. You can choose each panel’s position and orientation, so long as all panels are connected and within range. You cannot conjure a panel in a space occupied by a creature or a solid object.   The wall is physically solid and is weightless. Each panel has 10 Health and 100 Anything Shield.

Creatures within the field cannot cast spells, and new spells cannot target anything within the field. Any existing spell affecting a target within the field is temporarily suppressed on that target.

        "excerpt": "Evokers are combat mages who excel in causing massive magical destruction. They blast creatures and structures to pieces with long-range advanced combat magic and elemental explosions. Evokers are often employed as soldiers or warmages, as their explosive area spells can devastate entire formations of mundane soldiers.   Evoker talents focus entirely on causing damage. Most of these talents are different kinds of magical blast attacks, and the rest buff other magical attacks. Evoker talents include almost no defensive or utility abilities, which can make blasters into glass cannons. Evoker ribbons give them minor utility abilities to support their offense.   Examples of evokers in fiction include the black mages from Final Fantasy, any D&amp;D caster that specializes in evocation, and most combat-oriented mages and sorcerers from RPGs.

        "excerpt": "Illusionists are tricky mages who deceive enemies with clever illusions. Illusionists never fight directly, but instead manipulate other creatures’ senses to make them see things that aren’t there or overlook things that are. Many illusionists work as performers, artists, or technical crew, as their magic opens up new possibilities in the performing arts.   Illusionist talents include a variety of ways to distract or disable enemies. Many illusionist talents force enemies to waste time attacking things that aren’t really there. Others manipulate creatures’ minds directly, causing confusing or inciting strong emotions. Illusionist ribbons are mostly small-scale illusions useful out of combat.   Examples of illusionists in fiction include Loki from Marvel Comics, Genjutsu-users from Naruto, and almost every magic-user in real-world mythology.

At the GM’s discretion, you can make up a new effect instead of choosing one from the list.   Blur. All creatures have terrible visibility to everything in the area.   Silence. Nothing in the area can produce sound.   Stench. Creatures that start their turn in the area must succeed on a Strength roll or be dazzled until the start of their next turn.

Your clone apepars at the target point, and is a Minion creature that you control. Your clone has all the same stats as you, except its maximum Health is 1. Since your clone is an intangible illusion, it cannot physically interact with the world, but it can still be hurt by attacks. Your clone cannot use any powers except for basic powers that don’t affect the world, such as Stride.   You have a telepathic link with your clone that lets you communicate instantly and share each others’ senses: you can see through each others’ eyes and feel everything the other feels. Your clone is perfectly loyal to you and obeys all your commands.   Your clone has duplicates of all your equipment. However, duplicated magic items lose their magic, and all duplicated equipment fades a few seconds after it is no longer touching your clone.   Heightened   For each +1 Mana, you conjure twice as many clones.   If you add +1 Mana, your clone is a tangible creature and can interact with the world. Your clone can use all basic powers. Your clone’s maximum Health is equal to five times your Illusionist level.   If you add +1 Mana, your clone can cast all spells you know. You and your clone share the same Mana pool.

The illusion can change the appearance of your target’s worn and held items, but any item your target removes or drops returns to its true appearance.

This is enough to completely hide you from anyone who is not actively searching for you. Other creatures can still try to determine your location through sound clues, puffs of dust, or odd breezes.

Critical Success   Double damage and double fatigue   Success   Your target takes 8d6 damage and gains 1 fatigue   Failure   Half damage   If your target knows Dream as well, they can attempt to take control of the dream. If you fail or critically fail the attack roll, your target takes no damage and can immediately use Nightmare against you.

While the dream occurs in an instant, your target perceives the dream as lasting several minutes. You can observe your target’s reactions in the dream and shape it accordingly, so you can use Dream to hold a conversation.   Optionally, you can choose for the dream to appear as a terrifying nightmare. If you do, use the Nightmare effect on your target.   Heightened   For each +1 Mana, the damage of Nightmare increases by 2d6.

You can move the area of Major Image up to 60 feet. You can have the illusion act or move in a way that appears completely natural, or you can change the illusion to depict something completely new.

The spell does not affect any creatures or objects other than your target.   For example, if you cast Major Image with Phantom Spell, then only your target would be able to perceive the illusion. If you cast Invoke Blast with Phantom Spell, then only your target would see the effect or take damage.                                                   Swap with Clone                                                                           You reveal that you were actually an illusory clone all along                                 Retroactive                                Prerequisites         Illusory Clone                  You and a clone actually swapped places in the past, so you’re really somewhere else! Cast Illusory Clone now, and declare how long ago in the past that you actually cast the spell, as well as what your true self has been doing the whole time. You cannot contradict established events, and your true self cannot have taken any actions that rely on a die roll to succeed.   If you add +2 Mana to the cast of Illusory Clone, you can use this power as a  power that triggers when you are targeted by any power. This powers targets your clone instead.

For example, an illusory spike is Piercing, while an illusory lava flow is Fire.   Make a Magic attack roll against your target’s Defense.      Success   Your target takes 2d6 damage   Heightened   For each +1 Mana, the damage increases by 2d6.                                    Concentrate                                Range         120 feet              Requirements         Your target is affected by an ongoing Illusion spell                  You modify the target illusion to show something different. You can modify the illusion in a smooth way so that it appears to animate naturally. If the illusion covers an area, you can move the area up to 30 feet.   Optionally, as you alter the illusion, you can have it briefly become real for a fraction of a second. This generally has no permanent effect on the world, but an illusory flame could start a fire, or an illusory giant could shake the ground as it steps. To use this effect to deal damage, use the Painful Illusion power.   For example, if you are disguised by an Illusory Disguise, you could alter the disguise to make you look like a different creature. Alternatively, if an enemy cast Static Image to create a stone wall, you could alter the wall to have an opening for you to see or walk through.   As another example, if you cast Static Image or Major Image to create an illusory person, you could animate the person to appear to walk naturally, speak, and so on. You could even have this person run up and punch someone, using Painful Illusion on the target of the not-so-illusory punch.

At the end of each of your turns, you can move the fog up to 60 feet.   You can use the Distracting Fog power.   Heightened   For each +1 Mana, the radius of the burst increases by 20 feet.

At any time, your target can choose to act despite these hazards. If they do, this spell immediately ends and your target takes 14d8 damage.   Make a Magic attack roll against your target’s Intellect DC.

For example, you could change your eye color, your hairstyle, or the pattern on a tattoo. This change isn’t large enough to disguise your identity.                                                   Dancing Lights                                                                           You conjure a group of colorful, moving magical lights                                 Cantrip              Light              Spell                                Cost         0 Mana              Range         30 feet              Duration         Sustained, up to 1 minute                  You conjure four balls of colorful magic light at points within range. You control the lights’ brightness, shape, and color. When you sustain this spell, you can move the lights to new points within range and you can change the properties of the lights.

For example, you could make a sword look like a walking stick, or you could make a small stone look like a valuable gem.   Heightened   If you add +1 Mana, this spell’s duration changes to 24 hours.

The entire image must fit within the spell’s area.   Alternatively, you conjure a sound originating from the spell’s area. This power loses the Illusion trait and gains the Auditory trait.

        "excerpt": "Necromancers are dark casters who manipulate death, undeath, and fear. They raise undead minions to do their bidding and cast powerful death spells to slay their enemies. Necromancers are widely feared by the general population for their dark magic, as their spells have a terrible potential to do harm if misused.   Necromancer talents focus on offensive and utility effects. Some talents channel necrotic energy to harm the living, while others weaken the barrier between life and death and interact with the spirits of the dead. Necromancer ribbons give mostly utility effects related to the necromancer’s unique closeness with death.   Examples of necromancers in fiction include Nagash from Warhammer Fantasy, the White Walkers from A Song of Ice and Fire, and almost all fictional undead characters.

        "excerpt": "Sorcerers are powerful casters who directly manipulate the structure of reality. They bend space and time, move objects with their mind, and conjure objects out of nowhere. Sorcerers are especially known for their command of teleportation magic, as the most powerful sorcerers can cross entire continents in an instant.   Sorcerer talents include a variety of effects related to manipulating reality. Some of these talents act as direct attacks or defenses through telekinesis. Others warp time to apply unique buffs or debuffs to other creatures. Sorcerer ribbons give them minor utility effects related to their control over space and time.   Examples of sorcerers in fiction include Dr. Strange from Marvel Comics, the Green Lanterns from DC Comics, and most fictional reality manipulators or grand wizards.

        "excerpt": "Awakened are normal animals that were granted incredible intelligence through magic. The Awaken spell was invented by a well-meaning druid who sought to equalize animals and humanoids. However, the spell worked too well: the awakened animals were even more intelligent than humanoids! The confused and fearful humanoids pushed the awakened away, and most awakened retreated to live solitary lives in their home forests. The Awaken spell was passed down through the generations, so that new animals are slowly being awakened even today.   Physical Description   Awakened appear almost completely like their original animal forms. The main physical difference between awakened animals and their natural relatives is that awakened animals have opposable thumbs that let them use tools as well as humanoids. Awakened have very sophistical brains compared to normal humanoids. Some awakened can instantly solve complex math puzzles, build incredible technological gadgets, or even channel innate psionic powers. Any type of animal can be awakened: bears, gorillas, raccoons, velociraptors, and cats are common.   Awakened in Society   Most awakened live separately from humanoid society. Awakened rarely build settlements, preferring a natural lifestyle in tune with nature. Awakened sometimes live alongside non-awakened animals, which they might see as relatives who haven’t yet been given the gift of intelligence. The awakened are loosely governed by the druidic conclaves that spread knowledge of the Awaken spell. These druidic conclaves awaken new animals as fast as they can, but the complex Awaken spell can only be cast by the most powerful druids, which greatly limits the rate of growth of the awakened population.

        "excerpt": "Dwarves are short and hardy humanoids with a reputation as determined and skilled workers. While they originally came from massive underground fortresses in the mountains, most dwarves now live in urban areas alongside members of all races.   Physical Description   Dwarves are shorter than humans, and usually stand around 4 feet tall. Dwarves are stouter and denser than their frames might suggest, so they weigh about the same as humans and have similar physical strength. Male and female dwarves have similar builds, with no significant gender difference in weight or height. Dwarves live about twice as long as humans, usually 120-150 years. They have the typical range of skin and hair colors, though both male and female dwarves grow long facial hair. Most dwarves braid their beards into long, intricate patterns, often incorporating metal jewlery or rings.   Dwarves in Society   Dwarves have a reputation as skilled workers, especially in mining, smithing, constructing, cooking, and jewelry. In most cities, the best and most experienced crafters around will all be dwarves. This might come from their cultural work ethic, or perhaps their longer lifespan means they can spend more time perfecting their skills. Every town and city need as many skilled crafters, workers, and merchants as possible, so dwarves are welcomed with open arms in most areas.   Many dwarves live in tight-knit clans. Dwarves in the same clan protect and support one another. Adult dwarves teach the children of their clan, passing on their professional skills to the next generation. Most marriages are between dwarves of the same clan, so two dwarves in the same clan are more likely than not related to one another through some distant chain of ancestors. Dwarven clans often construct new neighborhoods to live in, so many large cities will have dwarven quarters with amazing architecture and a large population of dwarves.

        "excerpt": "Elves are long-lived humanoids who are known for their grace, elegance, and culture. An elf can master many subjects over the centuries, but the years often leave them with strange eccentricities. Elves tend to develop psionic powers over the years, so the oldest elves are strange, eldritch sages with versatile knowledge and abilities.   Physical Description   Elves are the same height as humans on average. Elves are slimmer than humans, giving them superhuman grace but lower strength. They have long and sharply-pointed ears, and they have similarly sharp and angled facial features. Elves have the same range of skin, hair, and eye colors as humans. Elves of both genders tend to wear their hair long instead of cutting it short. Elves mature many times slower than humans, reaching adulthood at around 50 years old. Elves never age past their physical prime, and they never die of old age.   Elves in Society   Elves are often envied by humans for their lifespan. At a glance, it’s impossible to tell if an elf is 60 years old or a thousand. Even after elves stop aging physically, they continue to age mentally. Younger elves tend to be reckless and confident, while older elves tend to be eccentric and conceited. This mental age often brings the gift of psychic powers, which are more common among elves than any other ancestry. However, as the countless years take their toll, the oldest elves slip towards erratic behavior or outright insanity.   Most elves live in small, insular communities with like-minded elves. These communities are led by the oldest elves, who are both the most eccentric and the most set in their ways. Some leaders drive their communities to extreme behaviors: some repress all of their emotions, only talk telepathically, or treat trees as people. Many young elves move to human cities to escape their birth communities, rejecting the oppressive elders and their extreme way of life.

        "title": "Goblin",
        "excerpt": "Goblins are short, green-skinned humanoids who stand roughly 3 feet tall. While they appear vaguely similar to humans, goblins are actually a type of fungus. Their green skin comes from chlorophyll, they have no biological genders, they reproduce asexually by spreading spores, they are vulnerable to fire, and they can draw some energy from sunlight.   Physical Description   Goblins have oversized heads and misshapen, bulbous torsos. They have very sharp teeth than can chew through almost any material, and tough stomachs that can digest even more. Goblins mutate significantly between generations, so each goblin looks different than its parent. These mutations often manifest as deformed facial features or strange lumps. Most goblins live for a very short time, only 5-30 years.   Goblins follow a radically different lifecycle than normal species. An adult goblin’s body contains thousands of spores, which they can plant one at a time, or that release all at once upon death. Spores can float on the wind or be carried by unwitting animals for months. Any spore that reaches a suitable environment (low light, rich soil, some water, and geothermal energy) will start to grow. A young goblin that emerges from a spore carries some instinctual memories from its parent and grows to physical adulthood after only a year.   Goblins in Society   Most goblins live apart from human society, as their biology gives them a very different set of needs and goals. Goblins are less concerned with social status and wealth than humans, as they aren’t driven to marry or provide for children in the same way. It is rare to see a goblin work to cultivate a positive reputation or try to amass material wealth. On the other hand, goblins care much more about creating or protecting the spaces where their spores can grow. Most goblins live in or near these spaces: city sewers, underground cave structures, or dense forest floors.   Very few non-goblins are aware than goblins are fungi instead of mammals. This misunderstanding has led to discrimination, as some humanoids see goblins as uncivilized, insane, or deformed. This prejudice makes it hard for goblins to succeed as part of human society. Some goblins try anyways, as they work to ensure government and economic institutions respect goblins’ unique needs. These reformers are slowly reducing personal and systemic racism against goblins.

At the end of each of your turns, you take 1d6 damage. If this damage is completely negated (such as by any Fire Shield you have), this power immediately ends.

        "title": "Kami",
        "excerpt": "Kami are divine spirits, the natural rulers of the world. While all kami are gods, some are more powerful than others. The major kami have the power to create and destroy planets, and are worshipped by millions of humanoids around the world. The minor kami described here are mere functionaries or bureaucrats in the celestial bureaucracy, the spirit government that oversees the entire world. Most kami live in Heaven, a giant palace in the spirit world that acts as the seat of the celestial bureaucracy.   Each kami holds a specific role in the celestial bureaucracy, called their domain. A major kami might be in charge of all storms and weather, while a minor kami serving them might be in charge of just lightning strikes. A kami’s office in Heaven gives them near-total control over their domain: the minor kami of lightning can send bolts of lightning from anywhere they want from inside of a storm cloud. Outside of their office, a kami has little more divine power than anyone else.   Physical Description   Kami are spirits. Like all spirits, they don’t age or reproduce. Unlike the wild fey spirits, kami have static humanoid forms. The only thing that distinguishes a kami from a normal human/elf/dwarf/etc. are minor physical features inspired by their domain. A kami of lightning might have sparkling yellow eyes and constantly generate static electricity, while a kami of a water might have blue hair and an exceptional ability to swim.   Kami in Society   Kami are all organized into a strict hierarchy in the celestial bureaucracy. Each kami has a direct superior, who has another direct superior, which extends in a long bureaucratic chain. At the top are the Secretary of Creation (who commands the entire world), and even above them, the Jade Emperor (who rules all of existence). Kami are obligated to follow all orders given by their superiors. This is merely one rule of the massive divine legal code of Natural Law. A kami who disobeys Natural Law will attract the attention of the dreaded higher-ups. Major legal violates will cause a kami to be excommunicated from the celestial bureaucracy. An excommunicated kami is analogous to a fallen angel in Christian mythology. They are viewed as evil, heretical, and flawed, and they are totally unwelcome in Heaven.   While most kami live in Heaven, the more adventurous kami might travel to or live in the material world. Since all popular religions worship major kami, a minor kami in the material world might act as an emissary or priest of their a religion. Humanoids generally treat kami with reverence, especially kami who serve a major kami they worship. However, proving you’re a kami can be difficult, as kami are physically identical to humanoids.

        "excerpt": "Lizardfolk are scaled, reptilian humanoids who can mutate to copy the traits of animals they eat. Normal lizardfolk have minor adaptations that make them strong, fast, and adaptable. The oldest and strongest lizardfolk have mutated to become giant monsters with awesome size and power. Stories of dragons, basilisks, dinosaurs, and the like are usually about powerful lizardfolk.   Physical Description   Lizardfolk are slightly larger than humans, usually standing around 6 feet tall and weighing 150-200 pounds. Lizardfolk are covered in colorful scales, usually green or sometimes blue, grey, or brown. Lizardfolk have softer and paler scales along their chest and stomach, and a ridge of tougher spiky scales down their back. Some lizardfolk (most commonly male lizardfolk) have a large crest along the back of their head and neck, which changes in color as they mutate. All lizardfolk have large and strong tails, which act like a third leg and help them balance.   Society   Lizardfolk usually live in rural communities near swamps, coastlines, or rivers. Most prefer living near nature instead of behind high walls. While wandering monsters pose a severe danger, those same monsters give lizardfolk the chance to mutate. In cities, lizardfolk prefer to live near rivers and lakes, where they can swim around and hunt fish. Lizardfolk are sometimes seen as exotic by more insular humans or elves, but in general they’re common and well-accepted in cities. Large mutated lizardfolk are rare, but when seen, they can alarm people who are frightened of dragons or other monsters.   Character Stats      Small Lizardfolk     One common lizardfolk ethnicity has adapted to be especially small and nimble. These lizardfolk, sometimes called kobolds or sneks, stand roughly 3 feet tall and lack the powerful muscles of their larger cousins.

        "title": "Outsider",
        "excerpt": "Outsiders are eldritch spirits that feed off of the emotions of humanoids. Each individual outsider feeds on a different emotion. Outsiders are categorized as angels or devils depending on the emotion they absorb: angels eat positive emotions, while devils eat negative emotions. An angel might feed off of Satisfaction or Amusement, while a devil might feed off of Shame or Disappointment.   Physical Description   Outsiders are spirits. Like all spirits, they don’t age or reproduce. Outsiders’ physical bodies are magical constructs made of stone, clay, or similar materials. Over time, an outsider can reshape their body to appear as any form they choose. Most outsiders choose normal humanoid forms in order to blend in to society. When an outsider is hurt, their body starts to disintegrate, as chunks of material fall off of their form.   Instead of eating and drinking, outsiders power their bodies by absorbing emotions from nearby humanoids. This absorption affects all humanoids within a few hundred feet. This slightly dampens the emotions of the affected humanoids, but the effect is usually too subtle to notice. An outsider who lives in a town or city can easily survive off the emotions of the other inhabitants.   Outsiders in Society   Outsiders almost always live in towns and cities alongside members of other races. Outsiders never live completely apart from others, as isolation means starvation. Most outsiders have specific emotions that they prefer to eat above all others, in the same way most humans prefer sweet cake to stale bread. For example, an angel who eats Satisfaction might prefer The Satisfaction of Eating a Good Pastry, or a devil who eats Shame might prefer The Shame of Having an Embarassing Secret Exposed. To get a quality meal, outsiders often try to inspire these specific emotions in nearby humanoids. This can make outsiders come across as manipulative or creepy to members of other races.   Other races are usually not fond of outsiders. This stems from outsiders’ tendency towards emotional manipulation - it’s hard to feel comfortable when your neighbor is constantly trying to mess with your emotions. This has led to false depictions of outsiders as murderous shapeshifters and malevolent villains. All major religions condemn outsiders as spiritual abberations, as the kami claim that outsiders violate the normal cycle of life and death. Most outsiders choose to hide from this racism, pretending to be normal humanoids.

Your phylactery can be any item: an article of clothing, a weapon, a holy symbol, or so on. You must always stay nearby your phylactery.

        "title": "Undead",
        "excerpt": "Undead are the partially reanimated bodies or souls of dead creatures. An undead is created when a dead soul is stuck in the material world because of necromantic magic or strong lingering attachments. If only a small part of the soul is still attached to the world, this creates a lesser undead, a mindless corpse powered by a tiny soul fragment. (Lesser undead only know how to destroy and consume, and are not an option for player characters.) However, if the soul manages to stay in the world entirely, it becomes a greater undead, a fully sentient creature animated by the conviction of the dead soul.   Physical Description   Undead are animated humanoid corpses. Their bodies are partially rotting and decayed, but are also preserved through magic. The stronger an undead’s attachment to the material world, the stronger this preserving magic, and the healthier their bodies appear. A determined and willful undead might appear indistinguishable from a living humanoid of their race. An older, less attached, or mentally unstable undead would appear extremely decayed or even completely skeletal. Less stable undead may have glowing red eyes, exude an aura of darkness, or be partially ethereal.   Undead in Society   Lesser undead are a constant menace to society. They form naturally and easily, as many souls die with moderate lingering attachments to the material world. Any time a person dies, there’s a risk of a murderous undead rising from their grave. Thankfully, Ceremony spells are common and can easily prevent undead from rising. In most humanoid cultures, priests are responsible for burying all citizens and fighting off the menace of undeath.   Greater undead are very different from lesser undead, but that doesn’t stop some people from conflating the two. Some ignorant humanoids tar all undead with the same brush, labeling greater undead murderers and threats to society. The loudest of these people are often the priests and kami who fight the threat of lesser undead every day. Racist discrimination propagated by organized religion is a fact of life for many undead. Some undead avoid this discrimination by hiding their race, pretending to be humanoids, while others work to prove the stereotypes wrong.

Ancestry Feats      These feats are available only to undead characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Detach Body Part                                                                           You can detach your body parts, which continue to function normally                        Recall Body Part                                        Choose one body part currently detached from your body. The detached body part moves 5 feet towards your body, stopping if it hits a solid object.                                      Duration         1 hour, until the body part falls to 0 health, or until you reattach the part                  Choose one body part, such as a hand, an eye, or so on. This body part detaches from the rest of your body, falling to the ground. While detached, the body part continues to function normally: eyes can still see, fingers can still move, and your head can still send orders to the rest of your body. Your body part has 10 Defense and 10 Health.   Losing body parts limits what your normal body can do. If you detach a hand or arm, you can’t wield items in that hand. If you detach a leg or foot, you are slowed. If you detach both your eyes, you can’t see from your normal body. If your body part is detached when this power ends, you permanently lose that body part. You regenerate lost body parts over the course of 1 week.   You instinctively know the distance and direction to all your detached body parts. You can use the Recall Body Part power.   For example, you could detach your eye and roll it beneath a door to watch events on the other side. You could split your body into a number of small pieces to cram into a tight space. You could detach your hand to have it crawl towards someone to creep them out.                                           Incorporeal Move                                                         You can walk through walls for a limited distance                  When you Stride, you can walk through walls and other solid objects. If you end your Stride inside of a solid object, you take 2d6 Force damage and are ejected to the nearest empty space.                                           Lifesense                                                                           You sense the number and location of all nearby living creatures                                 Divination                                Range         120 feet                  You learn the location and Size of each biologically living creature within range. This power does not show constructs, outsiders, undead, or other creatures without biological processes.                                           No Vital Organs                                                         You take reduced damage from critical hits since you have no weak points                  When a Physical attack critically succeeds against you, you take damage as if that attack had only been a success.                                           Paralyzing Touch                                                                           You paralyze a creature you touch                                 Attack              Encounter              Necrotic                                Target         One creature you can reach              Duration         Until the end of your next turn                  Make a Spirit attack roll against your target’s Spirit DC.
