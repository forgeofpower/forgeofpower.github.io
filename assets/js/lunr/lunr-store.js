        "excerpt": "Following are rules for interacting with the world.   Resting   The best way to recover from difficult combats is to spend some time resting. The benefits you gain from a rest depend on the length of the rest. You can perform light activity during a rest, such as standing guard, setting up camp, or eating a meal. Stressful activies, including combat or enduring harsh weather, interrupt a rest.   If you take a 5-minute rest, you recover the ability to use any Encounter powers you have expended. If you take a 1-hour rest, you heal an amount equal to half of your Health stat (this effect cannot occur again until you take an 8-hour rest). If you take an 8-hour rest, during which you get at least 5 hours of sleep, you heal an amount equal to your Health stat, and you recover the ability to use any Daily powers you have expended.   Carrying Capacity   Your carrying capacity is determined by your Strength and your Size. This value represents the maximum weight you can lift without too much trouble. You can lift up to twice this weight for a short time.   To compute your carrying capacity, plug your Strength into the table below. If your Size is greater than +0, multiply the result by 4 for each +1. If your Size is less than +0, divide the result by 4 for each -1.           Strength     Carrying Capacity      -550 lbs   -457 lbs   -366 lbs   -276 lbs   -187 lbs   +0100 lbs   +1110 lbs   +2130 lbs   +3150 lbs   +4170 lbs   +5200 lbs   +6230 lbs   +7260 lbs   +8300 lbs   +9350 lbs   +10400 lbs   NPC Attitude   What a non-player character thinks of the party will greatly affect how they interact with the players. NPCs have an attitude towards the party, which is one of the following values:      Helpful   The creature actively wishes to aid you, as long as doing so doesn’t go against its own goals or hurt its quality of life   Friendly   The creature likes you, and will generally agree to simple and easy requests   Indifferent   The creature doesn’t know you, or doesn’t care about you one way or the other   Unfriendly   The creature dislikes and distrusts you, and won’t agree to any of your requests   Hostile   The creature actively wishes to harm you, and might attack you or otherwise try to get in your way   Most NPCs start as indifferent towards the party. A creature you’re fighting is almost always hostile towards you. Aggressive or hurtful actions towards an NPC will greatly worsen their attitude towards you, while generous or kind actions towards an NPC might improve their attitude towards you.",

If you move across extremely difficult or hazardous terrain, the GM might ask you make a die roll to determine if your Stride power was successful.                       Strike                                                       Attack                                Target         One creature within your reach (for a melee attack) or within your weapon’s range (for a ranged attack)                  Make an attack roll against the target’s Defense. The attack roll is a Strength roll for melee weapons or an Agility roll for ranged weapons. Weapons with the Finesse trait let you choose either Strength or Agility for the attack roll.   When you make a ranged Strike, you can optionally choose to make a long-range Strike to try to hit a distant target. If you do, you have disadvantage on the attack roll, but your Strike has double the range.                       Critical Success         You deal damage equal to 2 * the weapon’s base damage + the attack roll’s attribute                   Success         You deal damage equal to the weapon’s base damage + the attack roll’s attribute                                        Sustain                                                       Concentrate                                Requirements         You have at least one spell active with a sustained duration                  Choose one spell with a sustained duration you have in effect. The duration of that spell continues until the end of your next turn. Some spells might have slightly different or expanded effects if you sustain them. If your Sustain power is disrupted, the spell immediately ends.

        "title": "Basic Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are some common rules for the game.   Die Rolls   When you attempt a task that has a chance of failing, you roll dice to determine if your attempt succeeds or fails. All die rolls are associated one stat, called the bonus of the die roll. This stat is usually an attribute or a skill, but can be any number. The die roll is usually referred to by this bonus: if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Strength attribute, then it’s called a Strength roll, or if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Stealth skill, then it’s called a Stealth roll.   To make the die roll, roll 1d20 and add the bonus, and note the result. Your result measures how effectively you attempt the task. Compare this value to the DC set by the GM, using the table below. If you roll a 20 on the die, then your result is one level of success higher than it would normally be. If you roll a 1 on the die, then your result is one level of success lower than it would normally be.   Levels of Success          Result     Values     Description           Critical Success     DC + 10 or more     An exceptionally good result, with bonus positive effects           Success     DC + 0 ... DC + 9     You succeed at the task you were attempting           Failure     DC - 10 ... DC - 1     You fail at the task you were attempting           Critical Failure     DC - 11 or less     An exceptionally bad result, with possible negative effects      Difficulty Classes   The DC (Difficulty Class) of a die roll is usually determined by the GM based on how hard the task seems. The GM is encouraged to used the table below to help them decide the DC. Some abilities call for a die roll against a specific DC. For example, the Strike power calls for a die roll where the DC is your target’s Defense stat.   Sample Difficulties          Difficulty     DC     Description           Simple     10     Something a normal person could do with some effort           Average     15     A task a skilled professional could struggle with           Hard     20     Requires significant training to accomplish           Very Hard     25     Very difficult even for a skilled professional           Extremely Hard     30     Almost impossible except for the greatest masters alive           Impossible     40     At the edge of human achievement, never been done before      Advantage, Disadvantage, and Rerolls   Some effects can give you advantage or disadvantage on a die roll, representing a minor cicumstantial bonus or penalty. When you have advantage on a die roll, you roll the d20 twice and take the higher value. When you have disadvantage on a die roll, you roll the d20 twice and take the lower value. If you have both advantage and disadvantage on a die roll, you only roll the d20 once.   Some effects let you reroll a die roll after it’s made. When you do, repeat the exact same die roll, with the same bonuses, penalties, advantage, and disadvantage as the original. Then, you can pick whether to use the original die roll or the new one.   Turns in Combat   Characters take turns during combat, as who acts first can be very important. When a fight breaks out, everyone involved makes an Initiative roll. Whoever gets the highest result takes the first turn. On your turn, you can use one  power and any number of  powers. You can’t use the same  power more than once on the same turn.   At the end of your turn, you pick who takes the next turn, ally or enemy. If you attacked a creature, that creature can choose to Interrupt your choice and take the next turn instead. No matter what, no one can take multiple turns in the same round. The round ends once everyone has taken a turn. The person who took the last turn in the round chooses who starts the next round. If you took the last turn in a round, you can choose yourself to go first the next round.   Attacks   Some powers represent offensive effects designed to hurt or impede enemies. These are called Attack powers, or just attacks for short. Attacks always involve a die roll, called the attack roll. The attacker makes the the attack roll only once, no matter how many targets the attack has. The attack roll specifies which of the target’s stat to use as the DC, usually Defense or an attribute DC. Since each target can have a different value for this DC, an attack can hit one target but miss another.   For example, the Strike power is an attack. Imagine that Alice uses the Strike power, slashing at Bob with a sword. Alice makes a Strength attack roll against Bob’s Defense. If the result of Alice’s attack roll is equal to or higher than Bob’s Defense score, then Alice’s attack is a success, and deals damage as described in the Strike power.",

        "title": "Character Creation",
        "excerpt": "As in other tabletop RPGs, before beginning character creation, you should talk with your group about the general setting and style of your game. Ask your GM what character level you’re starting at, and if they’re using any custom rules. Finally, grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make.   Step 1 - General Theme   The first step in making any character is deciding what you generally want your character to be. Will you be a powerful mage, casting arcane spells that reshape reality? A kung-fu master who can somersault and jump between enemies? A hardened soldier with a variety of weapons, who can tough through any situation?   In this step, you should develop these ideas more, working out the details of what you imagine your character will act and feel like. While you don’t have to write any of this down, you should keep it in mind as you create the rest of your character. The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.   Step 2 - Attributes   The next step is to determine your character’s attributes. Characters in Forge of Power have 4 attributes: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Spirit. Your score in each attribute is a single number, which can range from -2 to +10. The average value of an attribute for a normal human is +0. See the Attributes page for a description of each attribute.   Your starting score in each attribute is a number between -1 and +3. You can choose any starting scores you want such that your scores sum to a total to 4. For example, you could start with +3 Strength, -1 Agility, +2 Intellect, and +0 Spirit, since 3 - 1 + 2 + 0 = 4. Write your score in each attribute on your character sheet.   Improving Attributes   If you’re making a level 2 or higher character, your attributes are even higher. For every even level (level 2, 4, 6, etc.), choose to either:     Increase your highest attribute by 1   Increase two attributes lower than your highest attribute by 1 each   Step 3 - Ancestry   Choose one ancestry from the Ancestries page.   Step 4 - Class Levels   Your character’s main ability come from your class, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 20 classes in Forge of Power. See the Classes page for a full list of all classes and their descriptions.   When you create your character, you split your character level between the classes. Write your level in each class on your character sheet. Your character level and your level in a class determine your tier in the class, as shown in the table below:           Tier     Character Level     Class Level           Novice     1     1           Veteran     5     3           Master     11     5           Epic     17     7      Talents   Your character knows a number of talents from each class equal to your level in that class. All talents have a tier, which is shown next to the talent’s name. To learn a talent, you must be at least that tier in the talent’s c;ass.   For example, imagine you are creating a level 5 character. You could choose to put 3 levels in Blaster and 2 levels in Duelist. This makes you a Veteran Blaster and a Novice Duelist. You then learn 3 talents from the Blaster class, all of which must be either Novice or Veteran. You also learn 2 talents from the Duelist class, both of which must be Novice.   As another example, imagine you are creating a level 11 character. You could choose to put all 11 levels in the Arcanist class. This makes you a Master Arcanist. You then learn 11 talents from the Arcanist class, all of which must be Novice, Veteran, or Master.   Ribbons   In addition to talents, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are associated to classes, and are very similar to talents, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities.   You learn one ribbon at every odd character level (1, 3, 5, etc.). This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You can’t pick ribbons from a classes that you have no levels in, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.   Step 5 - Feats   Feats are abilities that represent your character becoming stronger generally, in a way that isn’t tied to any specific class. Feats are divided into four categories:     General Feats give you generally useful abilities that don’t fit into the other categories   Ancestry Feats give you special abilities related to your ancestry, and always have a specific ancestry as a prerequisite   Combat Feats make you better at combat, giving you damage bonuses to weapons or spells   Skill Feats make you better at skills, giving you bonuses to die rolls for those skills   All combat feats and skill feats give Perk bonuses. Perk bonuses only stack up to a certain amount depending on your character level. This cap limits the amount you can specialize in one area, so after you reach this cap, it’s better to choose other types of feats.   Starting Feats   Your character starts with two combat feats and four skill feats.   Extra Feats   You learn one additional feat for each character level, which can be from any category.   Step 6 - Other Stats   You’re now almost finished making your character! The only game mechanics task remaining is to write down a few numbers describing various aspects of your character.   Health. Your Health measures how much damage you can take before falling unconscious. Your Health is equal to 20 + Character Level + 4 * Strength.   Defense. Your Defense measures how well you can avoid, dodge, or parry physical attacks. Your Defense is equal to 8 + an attribute determined by your apparel.   Speed. Your Speed determines how far you can move when you Stride. Your character has a Speed of 30 feet.   Stat DC. You have a DC for each of your attributes. This measures how well you can defend against effects targeting that attribute. Your DC for a given attribute is equal to 10 + the attribute.   Magic &amp; Mana. If you can cast spells, you have two special stats, Magic and Mana. Your Magic determines the overall potency of your spells. Your Mana determines how many spells you can cast before running out of magical energy. See the Mystic Origins page for details.   Step 7 - Equipment   Don’t forget to buy equipment to use in your adventures! You start with (10 * your character level) gold pieces (gp). You can buy any equipment listed on the Equipment page.   Step 8 - Proficiencies   You can pick up the 10 proficiencies, which include:     Specific areas of knowledge   Languages   Tools   Musical instruments   Vehicles   Step 9 - Aspects   What your character will choose to do is as important as what your character has the power to do. Every player character has a list of Aspects, which are unique personality traits or flaws that define them. Your Aspects act as a guide to help you roleplay your character, and are useful for Setbacks. See the Narrative Rules page for details.   When you make your character, you should write down at least three Aspects that make you stand out. Feel free to add, modify, or remove Aspects at any time as your understanding of your character’s personality changes. The categories and random generators below can help give you ideas for your character’s Aspects.   Habits. These describe the obvious character actions that makes your character stand out from the average adventurer.     Weird Skills. These describe your character’s unique skills in strangely specific tasks, things you do better than anyone else.     Bonds. These describe the causes your character cares deeply about, the fundamental beliefs that drive you to act. They also describe the personal connections your character has with family, close friends, loved ones, organizations, or even special items.     Flaws. These describe character flaws that may impede your character and provide a source of narrative conflict.     Step 10 - Backstory   The final step in making a character is figuring out how you reached the start of the adventure. You should write down some basic notes about where your character was raised, any previous jobs you’ve held, and how you met the rest of the party. Your backstory is also the perfect place to introduce the NPC contacts that your character knows. The more detail you write, the better your GM will be able to merge this detail with the campaign setting.   Levelling Up   When you level up, you gain:     One talent   One feat   If it’s an odd level, one ribbon   If it’s an even level, one Attribute Score Improvement   In general, whenever you level up, you can change any character build decisions you made earlier, except what classes you have levels in. You can forget talents and learn new talents in their place, change your feats, and so on. Check with your GM before making especially drastic changes when you level up.",

The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.   Once you have a character in mind, you should go through the other steps on this page in order. Briefly, these steps are:     Ancestry: Choose your character’s race or culture   Background: Choose what your character did before adventuring   Classes: Choose your character’s special abilities   Development: Choose extra abilities that your character gets as they level up   Equipment: Choose your character’s starting equipment   Final stats: Write down the final numerical details on your character sheet   Narrative: Describe your character’s personality and backstory   At the end of each of the sections below, text in italics gives the exact mechanical steps you need to follow to create your character. If you’re in a hurry and you’re already familiar with this system, you can skip everything that’s not in italics.   Building Bruenor   In each of the sections below, I give an example of how to build a character. I use the same example character as D&amp;D 5e: the player Bob is creating his character Bruenor Battlehammer, a dwarven warrior-king who longs to rebuild his lost ancestral fortress of Mithril Hall. Bob imagines Bruenor as a tough frontline warrior who protects his friends, so he stays on the lookout for abilities that will boost Bruenor’s defense and melee combat skills.   Ancestry   Your character’s ancestry describes the abilities you gain from your ancestors. This includes biological abilities unique to your character’s species, such as a Lizardfolk’s mutations or an Undead’s physiology. It also includes cultural abilities you learned from the people who raised you, such as a Dwarf’s family connections or a Orc’s hardiness.   People of different ancestries are adept in different areas. For example, the average Orc is physically larger and stronger than the average Goblin. Your ancestry gives initial values for your four main attributes: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Spirit. Your ancestry also gives values for your Speed and Size.   Many ancestries give you additional bonuses or choices. In particular, many ancestries ask you to choose an ancestry feat, which is a special type of power that represents an ability you gained from your ancestry.   Choose one ancestry from the Ancestries page, and write your choice on your character sheet. Write the stat values given by your ancestry on your character sheet. Note each of the additional bonuses given by your ancestry in the corresponding part of your character sheet.   Building Bruenor   Bruenor is a tough mountain dwarf. Bob says that Bruenor has the dwarf ancestry. This means that Bruenor starts with a +0 Strength, Agility, and Intellect, and +1 Spirit. Bruenor also starts with a Speed of 25 feet and a size of 0. Bob writes all of these stats on Bruenor’s character sheet.   The dwarf ancestry gives Bruenor two tool proficiencies and an ancestry feat. Bob chooses for Bruenor to be proficient in miner’s tools and blacksmith’s tools, and Bob chooses the Dwarven Resilience ancestry feat. Bob writes the two tool proficiences on the Proficiencies section of Bruenor’s character sheet, and he notes the feat on the Powers page of Bruenor’s sheet. Reading the Dwarven Resilience feat, Bob notes 5 Poison Shield and 5 Bludgeoning Shield on the Shields and Weaknesses section of Bruenor’s character sheet so that he’ll remember them later.   Backgrounds      Variant Rule         If you're in a hurry, choosing backgrounds can take up a lot of time. Instead of choosing two backgrounds as below, you can use the following simplified rules to pick skills, weapons, and proficiencies.      Pick any four skills and any two weapons. You gain the Skill Expertise power for each skill, and the Weapon Expertise power for each weapon.                 Skill Expertise                                   Perk         +2 to the chosen skill                  You have advantage on all die rolls with the chosen skill.                       Weapon Expertise                                   Perk         +1 damage to Strikes with the chosen weapon                  You have a +1 bonus on all attack rolls with the chosen weapon.             Your character’s backgrounds describe what your character did before they became an adventurer. This affects your character’s skills, proficiencies, and starting feats. You have two backgrounds, representing skills learned at different parts of your life. For example, your first background might represent your life as a child, and your second background might represent your life as an adult.   Your backgrounds always give you several skill feats and combat feats. These are special types of powers that represent your character’s training in various skills and weapons. These feats always come with an extra bonus, called a Perk bonus, that makes you better at rolls involving the skill or weapon. Depending on your character level, you can’t stack too many Perk bonuses on the same stat, as shown in the table below:           Character Level     Max Stacking           6 or less     1           7 ... 12     2           13 ... 18     3           19 or more     4      Your backgrounds also give you a number of proficiencies, which represent specialized knowledge in a particular tool, language, or field of study. Proficiencies differ from skills in that they’re much more specialized, and won’t come up as often in an adventure.   Choose two backgrounds from the Backgrounds page, and write your choices on your character sheet. Choose the skill and combat feats given by your backgrounds. Write all the feats you chose on your character sheet. Write all the perk bonuses you gained on your character sheet. Choose the proficiencies given by your backgrounds, and write them on your character sheet.   Building Bruenor   TODO   Classes   Your character’s main ability come from your class, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 20 classes in Forge of Power. See the Classes page for a full list of all classes and their descriptions. Your character is initially level 0 in each class. For each of your character levels, you gain a level in one class of your choice. This means that your character level is equal to the sum of all your class levels. Your character level and your level in a class determine your tier in the class, as shown in the table below:           Tier     Character Level     Class Level           Novice     1     1           Veteran     7     3           Master     13     5           Epic     19     7      The table above lists the requirements your character must meet in order to reach a tier in a class. For example, to be a Veteran Berserker, you must both have a character level of at least 7 and a Berserker level of at least 3.   Talents are the main abilities your character can use. They define your character’s combat abilities. Each class has a list of talents. Your character knows a number of talents from each class equal to your level in that class. All talents have a tier, which is shown next to the talent’s name. To learn a talent, you must be at least that tier in the talent’s class.   In addition to talents, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are very similar to talents, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities. You learn one ribbon at every odd character level (1, 3, 5, etc.). This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You can’t pick ribbons from a classes that you have no levels in, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.   Split your character level between the classes. Write your level in each class on your character sheet. Pick a number of talents from each class equal to your level in that class. Make sure you meet the tier requirements for each talent you pick. Write each talent you chose on your character sheet. Pick a number of ribbons equal to half your character level (rounded up), which can be from any class you have levels in. Write each ribbon you chose on your character sheet.   Building Bruenor   TODO   Development   TODO   Choose a number of feats equal to your character level, and write them on your character sheet. Choose a number of attribute boosts equal to half your character level (rounded down), and modify your attributes accordingly.   Building Bruenor   TODO   Equipment   TODO   Spend up to 10 * (your character level) gold on items. Write each item you bought on your character sheet. Write any remaining gold on your character sheet.   Building Bruenor   TODO   Final Stats   TODO   For each attribute, write the attribute DC (equal to your attribute score + 10) on your character sheet. Write your maximum health (equal to 10 + 2 * level + 5 * Strength) on your character sheet. Write your Defense score (given by your armor) on your character sheet.   If your character knows any spells, also do the following steps. Choose one mystic origin from the Mystic Origins page, and write it on your character sheet. Write your maximum mana (given by your mystic origin) on your character sheet.

        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to combat. See the All Powers page for a list of common actions you can take in combat.   Power Properties   Some powers have a range in feet. If the power doesn’t list a target or an area, it targets one creature you can see within range.   Some powers have an area. If the power lists a range, the area is centered on a point you can see within range, otherwise the area is centered on you. If the power doesn’t list a target, it targets all creatures in the area.   Some powers have a duration. When the duration ends, the power’s effect completely ends. The world returns to its normal state, as if the power hadn’t been used. Any permanent changes the power made to the world, such as inflicting or healing damage, don’t disappear when the power ends. You can’t end an ongoing power early unless it specifies that in its duration.   Surprise   If you start combat with a creature that isn’t prepared for an imminent attack, that creature is surprised for the first round of combat. Creatures that are surprised, that can’t see you, or that otherwise aren’t expecting you to attack are flat-footed against you.   Falling   If there is nothing supporting your character, you fall. You fall up to 500 feet each round. When you fall 10 or more feet, you take 1d6 damage for each 10 feet, up to a cap of 50d6 damage at 500 feet. The number of dice is reduced by half if you fall onto a soft surface, such as a pile of hay or a pool of water. You land prone if you take any damage from a fall.   Cover   Some environmental features, such as battlements or arrow slits, make it much harder for creatures to hit you with attacks. At the GM’s discretion, these environmental features may give you cover from enemies. In general, you have cover from an enemy if at least 3/4 of your body is blocked by a solid object. If you have cover from an enemy, you have a +5 bonus to Defense against their attacks.   Health   All characters have a Health pool that represents how healthy they currently are. Your Health pool stores a number of points, up to a maximum of your Health stat. When you take damage, you must subtract the damage taken from your Health pool. When you heal, you add the points healed to your Health pool. Your Health pool can never go below 0. While your Health pool is 0, you have the downed condition.   Some effects can give you a pool of temporary HP. When you take damage, subtract the damage from your temporary HP first, then subtract any remaining damage from your Health pool. Multiple sources of temporary HP do not stack, you only keep the highest.   Dying   TODO: Write this section",

You are flat-footed, and you have disadvantage on Notice rolls and attack rolls.   Bloodied  You are significantly injured. You have the bloodied condition whenever you at at half Health or below.   Dazzled  Your eyes are overstimulated. You have disadvantage on Notice rolls and attack rolls.   Downed  You are severely injured and are barely able to move. You are incapacitated, prone, and slowed, and you cannot stand up.   Flat-footed  You’re distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. Attack rolls against you have advantage.   Grabbed  You’re held in place by another creature, and you are flat-footed and immobilized.   Immobilized  You can’t use any power with the Move trait. If you’re immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a die roll against the DC of the effect holding you.   Incapacitated  You are unable to fight. You can’t use any  or  powers.   Prone  You’re lying on the ground. You are flat-footed and have disadvantage on attack rolls. The only Move power you can use while prone is Stride, and you can only move by crawling. You have cover from enemies more than 20 feet from you.   Restrained  You’re tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You are flat-footed and immobilized, and you can’t use any powers with the Attack or Manipulate traits except the Escape power.   Slowed  Your speed is halved.   Stunned  You’ve become senseless.

You can choose your relative’s general personality, temperament, and profession, subject to the GM’s approval. Your relative is friendly towards you and will help you with simple favors, but will not risk their life to help you.   For example, if you are in a normal town, you can declare that your second cousin works as a blacksmith, and then go visit him to repair your sword. Or if you’re in the BBEG’s giant volcano lair, you can declare that your father’s brother-in-law’s niece works in the lair as one of the BBEG’s henchmen.                       Dwarven Resilience                         Dwarf               You have 5 Poison Shield. Choose one of the following:     You have 5 Fire Shield   You have 5 Cold Shield   You have 5 Bludgeoning Shield                       Logic Purist                         Elf               You have a +5 bonus to your DC against Emotion attacks and against Notice rolls to read your intentions or emotions.         You speak in a perfect monotone.                  Mind Meld                                   Elf                              Attack              Mental                                Target         One creature you can reach                  Specify the kinds of experiences you’re trying to share between you and your target. For example, you could choose to share memories of a certain event, current experiences of emotions, or thoughts on philosophy. The GM determines which exact experiences of this type are shared.   Make an Intellect attack roll against your target’s Intellect DC. (As with all rolls, you can choose to automatically fail or critically fail this roll.)                       Critical Success         You learn two experiences from your target                   Success         You learn two experiences from your target                        Critical Failure         Your target learns one experience from you                              Razor Teeth                                   Goblin               Make an unarmed Strike. The base damage of this strike is 1d4. This strike deals an extra 20 damage against inanimate objects.   You can efficiently tunnel through walls by repeatedly using this power. As a rough estimate, in one minute of work, you can tunnel through 1 foot of soft material (dirt, sand, plaster) or a few inches of hard material (wood, loose stones, old masonry). You can’t tunnel through materials you can’t damage, such as solid stone or metal.                       Underfoot                         Goblin               You can move through other creature’s spaces at full speed, even spaces occupied by enemy creatures. You can hide behind creatures that are larger than you.                       Dubious Knowledge                                   Human                              Daily              Retroactive               State a claim or rumor about the world that you have no evidence for but that might plausibly be true. The GM assigns a DC for this claim based on how extreme it is: a reasonble claim would be DC 5-10, a very unusual one might be DC 15, while a crazy or impossible claim would be DC 20 or more. The GM and the player should agree on the DC. Then, the GM rolls a d20 in secret. If this d20 meets or exceeds the DC, then the claim is actually true, otherwise, the claim is actually false.                       Natural Talent                         Human               You learn one Novice talent of your choice. This talent must be from a class that you have at least one level in.

When this effect ends, you reappear at a space of your choice within 10 feet of the part of your target you entered.                       Thoughts and Prayers                                   Kami                              Daily               You regain 2 Mana, plus 1 Mana for each devotee of your concept within 1 mile.                       Dragon's Breath                                   Lizardfolk                              Attack              Encounter                                Area         30-foot line                  When you first pick this feat, choose one of Acid, Cold, Electricity, Fire, or Poison. This power permanently gains that trait for you.   Make a Strength attack roll against your target’s Agility DC.                       Critical Success         Your target takes 4d8 + your character level damage                   Success         Your target takes 2d8 + your character level damage                   Failure         Half damage                                   Lizard King                         Lizardfolk               Your size increases by 1 and your reach increases by 5 feet.                       Clan Axe                         Orc               You have a clan axe, which has the stats of a bludgeon, a heavy weapon, or a throwing weapon. When you succeed on a Strike with your clan axe, you deal an extra 1 damage. You cannot be disarmed of your clan axe. If you ever lose your clan axe, you always somehow find it again the next day, even if your clan axe was seemingly stolen or destroyed. If you sell or willingly give up your clan axe, you permanently lose this power.                       Orc Drop                                   Orc                              Daily                                Trigger         You fall to 0 health                  You fall to 1 health instead.

Additionally, you notice a hidden bit of information of the DM’s choice about the creatures you’re tracking. For example, you might notice that the creatures are walking single-file to hide their numbers, that the tracks match a specific style of boot, or that the creatures were moving with unusual haste.

For example, you might notice that one section of a bookcase is suspiciously clear of dust, that an NPC’s bearing suggests they are feeling especially anxious, or a unusual footprint on a section of floor.         Use common sense to determine what counts as a room. We all speak English here.

You spread the phrase through the crowd of people, who take up the chant. The duration of this power depends on the chant - an insane or disagreeable chant will die down in seconds, while a popular and agreeable chant might last a long time. This power does not force anyone to agree with the content of the cheer - people are just caught in a wave of mob energy.

Your character states the rule out loud, explaining its importance to the faith and its origins as a belief. This rule is retroactively one of the core beliefs of your character’s religion. If past events in the campaign contradict this rule, then the rule isn’t very important to the average practicioner of your religion.   From now on, all believers in your character’s religion publicly follow the declared rule. Breaking the rule is considered a terrible taboo. If your character breaks the declared rule, they will lose reputation with other practicioners of their religion.

Critical Success         Your target makes a major faux pas, losing roughly 5 reputation with all observers                   Success         Your target makes a minor faux pas, losing roughly 2 reputation with all observers                        Critical Failure         You make a major faux pas, losing roughly 5 reputation with all observers                              Linguist                                   Society                              Daily              Perk                                Perk         +2 Society                  Choose a language that you don’t speak, but that you have seen or heard before. You must have observed at least 1 minute of communication in this language within the past 24 hours. You instantly create and learn a new pidgin language based on your observations. You can use the pidgin language to communicate simple ideas with creatures who speak the language you observed. It is very difficult to use this pidgin language to communicate complex ideas.                       Hide in Plain Sight                         Stealth                              Perk                                Perk         +2 Stealth                  You can attempt to hide even while being actively observed. You can attempt to hide even without any cover to hide behind.                       Just a Box                         Stealth                              Perk                                Perk         +2 Stealth                  You are an expert at placing inanimate objects in the perfect locations. Whenever you hide behind or inside of an inanimate, immobile object, you can slightly adjust this object to perfectly blend into its surroundings. Even if the object would normally be wildly out of place, no one notices the object is strange in any way. This effect ends if the object moves, if the object is a threat or obstacle, or if you are no longer hidden behind or inside of the object.   For example, you can hide inside of a box in the middle of the floor, and no one will question why the box is there so long as it stays still. You can hide behind a tall potted plant next to a lava lake in the middle of an evil dungeon, and no one will question the plant’s existence.

Anyone casually searching the area never realizes the mundane objects have any mechanical effect. Someone who is determinedly searching the area for traps or devices has a -10 penalty to any rolls made to detect the mechanism.

Success         You reveal you successfully pickpocketed your target, drawing the item and showing it to them, as your target either draws nothing or draws a useless fake copy of the item                                        Rasslin'                                   Wrestling                              Perk                                Perk         +2 Wrestling              Trigger         You succeed on a Grapple                  Make an unarmed Strike against the target of your Grapple.

        "excerpt": "Hello, and welcome to the core rulebook of Forge of Power! I assume that if you’re reading this, you’re already familiar with tabletop RPGs, like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, or Shadowrun. After years of playing these games, I found rules that I wanted to change, new mechanics I wanted to introduce, and interesting ideas I wanted to combine. The result was this system, Forge of Power, that takes all my favorite mechanics from across many systems and merges them together. I think the whole has become more than the sum of its parts.   Versatile Character Creation   Forge of Power tries to maximize the number of options available in character creation. Unlike D&amp;D or Pathfinder, characters in Forge of Power do not choose a single class that determines what your character does. Instead, whenever a character levels up, they can choose a talent, a special ability that makes the character much stronger in one way. Talents are organized by theme into collections of related talents, called classes. Characters are free to mix and match talents from different classes, letting you pick the perfect combination of talents to realize your character’s theme.   To expand your options even further, classes have minor abilities called ribbons, which make characters more flavorful or thematic, without greatly affecting your combat power. Ribbons separate out combat strength from roleplaying abilities, making it so every character always has unique strengths to offer both in combat and in social interactions.   Tactical Combat   Like many other roleplaying games, Forge of Power puts a heavy emphasis on combat. The game rules try to make combat as interesting as possible for all characters. All characters, magical and martial, have access to the same number of powers. This means that the fighter will have just as many interesting options to use in combat as the wizard. A lot of effort has been spent trying to balance the various powers against each other. No strategy in combat should ever clearly be much stronger than another.   Setting   Forge of Power was designed around a medieval fantasy world, just like D&amp;D or Pathfinder. Players can expect a setting where brave paladins fight against cunning devils, elven wizards duel against ancient dragons, and adventurers regularly delve into dungeons to slay monsters and recover hidden treasures. That said, the game rules never assume the game uses a specific setting, and groups can play this system in a universe of their choice. Forge of Power can be adapted to completely different settings with only minor modifications. Running a futuristic sci-fi game only requires changing the equipment list to add plasma guns, lightsabers, and spaceships. Running a realistic medieval game is as simple as banning all the “magical” classes.",

Instead of the spell taking effect, the spell is stored in a small item you touch. Any creature wielding that item can use that spell, expending it. You pay the spell’s cost when you use this power, and the spell uses your stats, but the other activating creature chooses the spell’s target and other parameters.

If you do, other creatures who are passively observing you don’t realize you’re casting or sustaining a spell, unless your spell has obvious physical effects. A creature who is actively studying you must successfully roll Intellect+Notice against your Spirit+Performance DC to realize you’re casting or sustaining a spell.

        "title": "Narrative Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are rules that help groups play out interesting stories.  ## Aspects  TODO: Write this section  ## Quests  The game is divided into **quests**, each of which has a single well-defined objective. Each quest has a current **Challenge** score, which usually starts at 1. When the party completes a quest, everyone gains XP equal to the quest’s Challenge score. A player character levels up whenever they reach a multiple of 10 XP.  Whenever the GM adds a complication to the quest, they should increase the Challenge by 1. Especially deadly complications might increase the Challenge by 2 or more.  The party can vote to spend 1 Challenge point to introduce a reasonable plot point that makes the quest easier, such as calling in allies to help, or adding a lucky coincidence that works in their favor. The GM determines whether a proposed plot point would be reasonable. Introducing a plot point can only trivialize the quest if it reduces the Challenge to 0.  ## Inspiration  Every player has a pool of **inspiration** points that they can spend to influence the story. You can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any die roll that any character makes. When you do, you must explain how your character somehow influences the roll. Even just yelling a few words of moral support counts.  You start every session with 1 inspiration point. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration. You can also earn inspiration through Setbacks (see below). Unspent inspiration goes away at the end of a session.  ## Setbacks  In books, movies, and shows, we constantly see characters act against their best interests. This makes for interesting, realistic stories of complex, flawed characters. These self-imposed setbacks often act to reinforce the theme of a story. A comedy show relies on exagerrated, silly characters who make humorous mistakes. A grim drama relies on characters with emotional scars that flare up at the worst times.  Forge of Power encourages these stories by compensating players for in-character setbacks. At any time, a player can propose a **Setback**, explaining how a character might act in a way that makes the current quest harder for the entire party. The proposed action has to match the game's theme: if you're running a comedic game, the Setback must be humorous, or if you're running a grimdark game, the Setback must be dark or hurtful. The proposed action must also directly relate to one of the character's Aspects.  The player who controls the character (or the GM, if the character is an NPC) can then choose to accept or reject the proposed Setback. If they accept the Setback, then the proposed action occurs in the game. Both the player who proposed the Setback and the player controlling the character gain 1 inspiration (if you Setback your own character, you gain 2 inspiration). The current quest's Challenge score increases by 1.  Setbacks have a few limitations. First, many Setbacks require an in-character action that can be blocked by other characters. For example, if the reckless character tries to charge into a fight, their party might grab them before they run off. If the action is blocked by other characters, the Setback is cancelled. Second, the same character can't be the cause of a Setback twice in a row. (The same player *can* propose two Setbacks in a row, if they want.) Third, you can't Setback the same Aspect twice in the same game session.",

Your character states the rule out loud, explaining its importance to the faith and its origins as a belief. This rule is retroactively one of the core beliefs of your character’s religion. If past events in the campaign contradict this rule, then the rule isn’t very important to the average practicioner of your religion.   From now on, all believers in your character’s religion publicly follow the declared rule. Breaking the rule is considered a terrible taboo. If your character breaks the declared rule, they will lose reputation with other practicioners of their religion.

You must have observed at least 1 minute of communication in this language within the past 24 hours. You instantly create and learn a new pidgin language based on your observations. You can use the pidgin language to communicate simple ideas with creatures who speak the language you observed. It is very difficult to use this pidgin language to communicate complex ideas.                                                                      Stealth    Good with Agility and Spirit.

Whenever you hide behind or inside of an inanimate, immobile object, you can slightly adjust this object to perfectly blend into its surroundings. Even if the object would normally be wildly out of place, no one notices the object is strange in any way. This effect ends if the object moves, if the object is a threat or obstacle, or if you are no longer hidden behind or inside of the object.   For example, you can hide inside of a box in the middle of the floor, and no one will question why the box is there so long as it stays still. You can hide behind a tall potted plant next to a lava lake in the middle of an evil dungeon, and no one will question the plant’s existence.

Anyone casually searching the area never realizes the mundane objects have any mechanical effect. Someone who is determinedly searching the area for traps or devices has a -10 penalty to any rolls made to detect the mechanism.

        "title": "Spell Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to spells.  ## Casting Spells  A power with the [[Spell]] trait is called a **spell**. Using such a power is called **casting** the spell. Casting a spell requires speaking a command phrase and making hand gestures, which usually make it obvious that you are casting a spell. All spells implicitly have the [[Concentrate]] and [[Manipulate]] traits.  Casting spells requires an **arcane focus**, which is a handheld item you use to channel your magic. You can meditate or focus for 1 hour to designate an item as your arcane focus. Bonding to a new arcane focus severs your connection with your previous focus. You can pick any item as your arcane focus - a staff, a book, a crystal gem, a sword, or so on. You must hold your arcane focus in one hand while casting a spell or using the {Sustain} power.  ## Mana  All characters that can cast spells have a Mana pool that represents how much magical energy they have available. Your Mana pool stores a number of points, up to a maximum of your Mana stat. When you pay Mana to cast a spell, you must subtract the amount paid from your Mana pool. Your Mana pool can never go below 0. Your [mystic origin](mystic-origins.html) determines your Mana stat and describes when your Mana pool replenishes.  All spells have a **cost** in Mana. You must pay this amount of Mana when you cast the spell. If you don't have enough Mana, you can't cast the spell. Some effects reduce the cost of a spell. You must always spend at least 1 Mana when you cast a spell, or at least 0 Mana if the spell has the [[Cantrip]] trait.  ## Heightening Spells  You can **heighten** some spells to increase their effect, at the cost of paying more Mana to use the spell. When you cast a spell, you can choose to pay more Mana than the listed cost, up to a limit of half your character's total Mana.  If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (per +X Mana)**, then for each X Mana you pay above the base cost, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (total X Mana)**, then if you pay a total of at least X mana, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's descriptions has multiple **Heightened** enties, then all of them apply.  ## Customizing Spells  Spells are flexible effects, and the caster has significant leeway in choosing how the spell is expressed. A powerful spellcaster who conjures vast firestorms could use that same spell to light a single candle. You can reduce the area, range, duration, or damage of a spell as much as you want when you cast the spell, though the cost stays the same. Ask your GM what other parameters you can change for a given spell. Once you cast the spell, you no longer have direct control over the magic, so you have to pick any changes when you cast the spell.  Players are encouraged to describe their spells differently than how they're described in the rules. For example, instead of describing your {Fireball} spell as an explosion of flames, you could describe it as a flash of lightning, an intense wave of radiation, or as briefly transporting targets to a Hell dimension. Your unique description for your spell is called the spell's Trappings.  Trappings shouldn't change how a spell functions in normal circumstances. The GM might say that Trappings change how a spell acts in unusual circumstances, such as a flash of lightning being more effective than a fireball when the target is underwater. Creatively using spells is cool, and should be encouraged.",

        "excerpt": "Berserkers are aggressive melee fighters who believe that the best defense is a good offense. They charge into enemy lines, lay waste to their opponents, and refuse to give up and die. Berserkers are notoriously angry, and are adept at channeling their rage into combat power.   Berserker talents give amazing boosts to melee damage. Some of their talents help them resist damage, but others lower their own defense in exchange for damage. Some berserker talents let them resist death or heal when they attack others. Berserker ribbons offer a variety of social and utility effects.   Examples of berserkers in fiction include Conan the Barbarian, the Hulk from Marvel Comics, and most fictional viking warriors.

        "excerpt": "Duelists are expert melee fighters who rely on their amazing skill with weapons. They excel in the art of the duel, specializing in one-on-one combat. Many duelists come from noble or gladiatorial backgrounds, where skill and elegance in combat are highly valued. Duelists most often wield swords.   Duelist talents focus on accurate attacks and impenetrable defenses. Many of their talents give them the chance to add another attack in a moment of opportunity or weakness in their opponent’s defenses. Duelist ribbons let them show off their skill and knowledge of all sorts of weapons.   Examples of duelists in fiction include Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher, Link from The Legend of Zelda, and Drizzt Do’Urden from The Forgotten Realms.

        "excerpt": "Swordsages are mystical fighters who perform supernatural feats of martial ability. They often fight in melee, but many swordsages try to avoid the front lines. Swordsages’ supernatural abilities come from their innate ki powers, which they might have unlocked through years of meditation and training.   Swordsage talents produce a variety of supernatural effects without relying on formal arcane magic. Their talents might create mirages of multiple attacks, turn the swordsage incorporeal as they dodge, or shape their ki into solid objects. Swordsage ribbons use ki for minor utility effects.   Examples of swordsages in fiction include almost all anime fighters that have supernatural abilities, as well as some high fantasy magic swordsmen and wuxia heroes.

        "excerpt": "Acrobats are agile combatants who leap and dodge between attacks. They move through the front line with ease, dodging enemy attacks and retaliating with speed and precision. Acrobats are known for their supernatural abilities to move on difficult terrain, running up walls, along water, or even walking on thin air.   Acrobat talents focus on movement and dodging attacks. The majority of acrobat talents are defensive, though a few give opportunities to disorient enemies or counterattack. Some acrobat talents combine movement and combat, giving stat bonuses for using the environment to your advantage. Acrobat talents give even more ways to move around the world.   Examples of acrobats in fiction include Ty Lee from Avatar: The Last Airbender, Spiderman from Marvel Comics, all the protagonists of Assassin’s Creed, and most fictional monks and swashbucklers.

        "excerpt": "Hunters are ranged warriors who focus on taking down targets with precise, deadly shots. They are unmatched when it comes to chasing and defeating single targets, as enemies can’t flee from their range and accuracy. Most hunters avoid fighting in melee, preferring to use their range to their advantage.   Hunter talents give a variety of boosts to ranged weapons and single-target attacks. Some talents give buffs to single long-range shots with high accuracy and damage, while others give buffs to attacks against specific targets.

        "excerpt": "Masterminds are leaders who support their team in and out of combat. They might be inspirational warriors who lead from the front, but they can also be noncombatants who lend aid without interfering directly. Masterminds are known for their supernatural planning abilities, staying three steps ahead of their enemies at all times.   Mastermind talents focus on supporting allies instead of acting directly. Many of these talents give tactical combat bonuses, letting their allies have extra actions, damage, or defense. Masterminds have almost no talents that affect only themselves.

        "title": "Scoundrel",
        "excerpt": "Scoundrels are sneaky fighters who prefer trickery to fighting fair. They are experts in twisting combats to their advantage, distracting and misdirecting enemies. Most scoundrels favor stealth and surprise attacks over direct combat. Scoundrels have a generally negative reputation as thieves, liars, and assassins.   Scoundrel talents give many ways to confuse or avoid enemies. They also include ways to exploit a distraction for all it’s worth, with powerful sneak attacks and finishing moves. Scoundrel talents also let them escape danger through luck or stealth. Scoundrel ribbons give more ways to sneak around and avoid getting caught.   Examples of scoundrels in fiction include Han Solo from Star Wars, Batman from DC Comics, Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Carribean, and Corvo Attano from Dishonored.

        "excerpt": "Awakened are normal animals that were granted incredible intelligence through magic.   Origin   Once upon a time, there was a powerful druid who lived in harmony with nature. This druid respected the inherent dignity of animals, but they felt that animals were looked down on by humanoids because of their lesser intelligence. This druid invented the Awaken spell to raise animals to the intelligence level of humans. However, this spell worked too well: the awakened animals were even more intelligent than humanoids! The confused and fearful humanoids pushed the awakened away, and the awakened retreated to live solitary lives in their home forests. The Awaken spell was passed down through the generations, so that new animals are slowly being awakened even today.   Physical Description   Awakened appear almost completely like their original animal forms. The main physical difference between awakened animals and their natural relatives is that awakened animals have opposable thumbs that let them use tools as well as humanoids. Awakened have very sophistical brains compared to normal humanoids. Some awakened can instantly solve complex math puzzles, build incredible technological gadgets, or even channel innate psionic powers. Any type of animal can be awakened: bears, gorillas, raccoons, velociraptors, and cats are common.   Society   Most awakened live separately from humanoid society. Awakened rarely build settlements, preferring a natural lifestyle in tune with nature. Awakened sometimes live alongside non-awakened animals, which they see as distant relatives that are too stupid to take care of themselves. The awakened are loosely governed by the druidic conclaves that preserve knowledge of the Awaken spell. These druidic conclaves awaken new animals as fast as they can, but the complex Awaken spell can only be cast by the most powerful druids, which greatly limits the rate of growth of the awakened population.
