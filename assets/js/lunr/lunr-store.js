        "excerpt": "Following are rules for interacting with the world.   Resting   The best way to recover from difficult combats is to spend some time resting. The benefits you gain from a rest depend on the length of the rest. You can perform light activity during a rest, such as standing guard, setting up camp, or eating a meal.   If you take a 5-minute rest, you recover the ability to use any Encounter powers you have expended, and your recover all of your Mana. If you take a 1-hour rest, you heal HP equal to half of your maximum HP (this effect can only occur once per day). If you take an 8-hour rest, during which you get at least 5 hours of sleep, you heal to full HP, and you recover the ability to use any Daily powers you have expended.   Inspiration   The GM is encouraged to reward players for good roleplaying with a mechanic called inspiration. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration. You can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any die roll or damage roll that your character makes. This is a Fortune effect.   NPC Attitude   What a non-player character thinks of the party will greatly affect how they interact with the players. NPCs have an attitude towards the party, which is one of the following values:      Helpful   The creature actively wishes to aid you, as long as doing so doesn’t go against its own goals or hurt its quality of life   Friendly   The creature likes you, and will generally agree to simple and easy requests   Indifferent   The creature doesn’t know you, or doesn’t care about you one way or the other   Unfriendly   The creature dislikes and distrusts you, and won’t agree to any of your requests   Hostile   The creature actively wishes to harm you, and might attack you or otherwise try to get in your way   Most NPCs start as indifferent towards the party. A creature you’re fighting is almost always hostile towards you. Aggressive or hurtful actions towards an NPC will greatly worsen their attitude towards you, while generous or kind actions towards an NPC might improve their attitude towards you.",

Attempt a Brawling check against the opponent’s Reflex save.                           Critical Success         You knock the item out of the opponent’s grasp. It falls to the ground in the opponent’s space.                       Success         You weaken your opponent’s grasp on the item. Until the start of that creature’s turn, attempts to Disarm the opponent of that item gain a +2 bonus, and the target takes a -2 penalty to Attack powers with the item or other rolls requiring a firm grasp on the item.                              Critical Failure         You lose your balance and become flat-footed until the start of your next turn                             Draw Item                                                   Manipulate                                        Trigger         Your turn begins                        You draw one item that is secured in an easily accessible location, such as a weapon in its holster or a potion in a belt pouch. Drawing items from a pack or picking them up from the ground requires the Interact power.                    Escape                                                   Attack                       You attempt to escape from being grabbed, immobilized, or restrained. Choose one effect imposing any of these conditions on you. Attempt a Acrobatics, Athletics, or Brawling roll against the DC of the effect (such as the Brawling DC of a creature grabbing you, or the Spell DC of a spell effect).

Attempt a Brawling roll against their Fortitude save. You can also use this power to keep your hold a creature you already grabbed.                           Critical Success         Your opponent is restrained until the end of your next turn, unless you move or your opponent succeeds on an Escape                       Success         Your opponent is grabbed until the end of your next turn, unless you move or your opponent succeeds on an Escape                       Failure         You fail to grab your opponent, and if you already had the opponent grabbed or restrained using Grapple, those conditions on that creature end                       Critical Failure         As failure, and your target can either grab you (as if it had succeeded at using the Grapple power against you) or force you to fall and land prone                             Help                                      You try to help your ally with a task. The task but be something you could reasonably help with, must involve a die roll, and must be completed before the start of your next turn. You must explain to the GM exactly how you’re trying to help, and they determine whether you can Aid your ally. Attempt a die roll (of a type decided by the GM) against DC 20.                           Critical Success         You grant your ally a bonus to the roll equal to your Prof                       Success         You grant your ally a +1 bonus to the roll                              Critical Failure         Your ally takes a -1 penalty to the roll                             Interact                                                   Manipulate                       You use your hand or hands to manipulate an object or the terrain. You can grab an unattended or stored object, open a door, or produce some similar effect. You might have to attempt a die roll to determine if your Interact action was successful.                    Interrupt                                                       Trigger         A creature ends its turn                Requirements         That creature used an Attack power against you on its turn, and you haven’t taken a turn yet this round                        You interrupt the normal turn order. Instead of the other creature deciding who takes the next turn, you take the next turn.                    Point Out                                                   Auditory                Manipulate                Visual                                        Requirements         A creature you can see is hidden to one or more of your allies                        You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies, gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally. The target is no longer hidden to your allies.                    Ready                                                   Concentrate                       You prepare to use an action that will occur outside your turn. Choose a single  power you can use, and designate a trigger. If the trigger occurs before the start of your turn, you can use the chosen power as a reaction.   If you have MAP and your readied power is an Attack, your readied power takes the MAP you had at the end of your turn.                    Seek                                                   Concentrate                Secret                       You scan an area for signs of creatures or objects. If precision is necessary, select a 15-foot burst within line of sight. The GM attempts a single secret Perception roll for you can compares the result to the Stealth DCs of any hidden creatures or objects in the area.                                  Success         You observe the creature or object, making it no longer hidden to you                                           Shove                                                   Attack                                        Requirements         You have at least one free hand, and your target is not more than one size larger than you                        You push an opponent away from you. Attempt a Brawling check against your opponent’s Fortitude save.                           Critical Success         You push your opponent up to 10 feet away from you. You can Stride after it, but you must move the same distance and in the same direction.                       Success         You push your opponent back 5 feet. You can Stride after it, but you must move the same distance and in the same direction.                              Critical Failure         You lose your balance, fall, and land prone                             Stride                                                   Move                       You move to an adjacent zone. If you’re moving across especially difficult terrain, the GM might ask you make a die roll to determine if your Stride action was successful.                    Strike                                                   Attack                       You attack with a weapon you’re wielding, targeting one creature within your reach (for a melee attack) or within range (for a ranged attack). Note that the weapon you’re using is associated with a skill (called the Weapon Skill) and a damage value (called the Damage Die). Make a Weapon Skill roll against your target’s AC.                           Critical Success         You deal damage equal to 2 * Damage Die + the Weapon Skill’s attribute                       Success         You deal damage equal to Damage Die + the Weapon Skill’s attribute                                           Sustain                                                   Concentrate                                        Requirements         You have at least one spell active with a sustained duration                        Choose one spell with a sustained duration you have in effect. The duration of that spell continues until the end of your next turn. Some spells might have slightly different or expanded effects if you sustain them. If your Sustain power is disrupted, the spell immediately ends.                    Trip                                                   Attack                                        Requirements         You have at least one free hand, and your target is not more than one size larger than you                        You try to knock an opponent to the ground.

        "title": "Basic Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are some common rules for the game.   Die Rolls   When you attempt a task that has a chance of failing, you roll dice to determine if your attempt succeeds or fails. All die rolls are associated one stat, called the bonus of the die roll. This stat is usually an attribute or a skill, but can be any number. The die roll is usually referred to by this bonus: if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Strength attribute, then it’s called a Strength roll, or if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Stealth skill, then it’s called a Stealth roll.   To make the die roll, roll 1d20 and add the bonus, and note the result. Your result measures how effectively you attempt the task. Compare this value to the DC set by the GM, using the table below. If you roll a 20 on the die, then your result is one level of success higher than it would normally be. If you roll a 1 on the die, then your result is one level of success lower than it would normally be.   Levels of Success          Result     Values     Description           Critical Success     DC + 10 or more     An exceptionally good result, with bonus positive effects           Success     DC + 0 ... DC + 9     You succeed at the task you were attempting           Failure     DC - 10 ... DC - 1     You fail at the task you were attempting           Critical Failure     DC - 11 or less     An exceptionally bad result, with possible negative effects      Difficulty Classes   The DC (Difficulty Class) of a die roll is usually determined by the GM based on how hard the task seems. The GM is encouraged to used the table below to help them decide the DC. Some abilities call for a die roll against a specific DC. For example, the Strike power calls for a die roll where the DC is your target’s AC.   Sample Difficulties          Difficulty     DC     Description           Simple     10     Something a normal person could do with some effort           Average     15     A task a skilled professional could struggle with           Hard     20     Requires significant training to accomplish           Very Hard     25     Very difficult even for a skilled professional           Extremely Hard     30     Almost impossible except for the greatest masters alive           Impossible     40     At the edge of human achievement, never been done before      Advantage, Disadvantage, and Rerolls   Some effects can give you advantage or disadvantage on a die roll, representing a minor cicumstantial bonus or penalty. When you have advantage on a die roll, you roll the d20 twice and take the higher value. When you have disadvantage on a die roll, you roll the d20 twice and take the lower value. If you have both advantage and disadvantage on a die roll, you only roll the d20 once.   Some effects let you reroll a die roll after it’s made. When you do, repeat the exact same die roll, with the same bonuses, penalties, advantage, and disadvantage as the original. Then, you can pick whether to use the original die roll or the new one.   Turns in Combat   Characters take turns during combat, as who acts first can be very important. When a fight breaks out, everyone involved makes an Initiative roll. Whoever gets the highest result takes the first turn. On your turn, you can use one  power and any number of  powers. After you use a  power once, it counts as a  power for you for the rest of your turn.   At the end of your turn, you pick who takes the next turn, ally or enemy. If you attacked a creature, that creature can choose to Interrupt your choice and take the next turn instead. No matter what, no one can take multiple turns in the same round. The round ends once everyone has taken a turn. The person who took the last turn in the round chooses who starts the next round.   Movement and Zones   When the group needs a precise map of an area, usually for combat, the GM divides the game world into zones. A zone is an abstract area, usually about 30 feet on a side. Every character is in a zone, and multiple character can be in the same zone. You can use the Stride power to move between zones.   Saving Throws   The three skills Fortitude, Reflex, and Will represent your character’s ability to avoid or resist various types of attacks. Die rolls made with these skills are called saves or saving throws. Unless otherwise specified, a saving throw against a damaging effect does the following.   Critical Success: You take no damage from the effect   Success: You take half the listed damage from the effect   Failure: You take the full damage listed from the effect   Critical Failure: You take double the listed damage from the effect",

      {
        "title": "Character Creation",
        "excerpt": "As in other tabletop RPGs, before beginning character creation, you should talk with your group about the general setting and style of your game. You should also grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make.   Step 1. Choose your General Theme   The first step in making any character is deciding what you generally want your character to be. Will you be a powerful mage, casting arcane spells that reshape reality? A kung-fu master who can somersault and jump between enemies? A hardened soldier with a variety of weapons, who can tough through any situation?   In this step, you should develop these ideas more, working out the details of what you imagine your character will act and feel like. While you don’t have to write any of this down, you should keep it in mind as you create the rest of your character. The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.   Step 2. Determine Attribute Scores   The next step is to determine your character’s attributes. Characters in Forge of Power have 6 attributes: Strength, Agility, Precision, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Your score in each attribute is a single number, which generally ranges from -1 to +5. The average value of an attribute for a normal human is +0. See the Attributes page for a description of each attribute.   Your starting score in each attribute is a number between -1 and +3. You can choose any starting scores you want such that your scores sum to a total to 6. Write the final values of your attributes on your character sheet.   Step 3. Choose your Skills   You now choose what skills your character specializes in. Skills are divided into two broad categories. Combat skills, which are always used during combat, represent your experience with types of weapons or magic. General skills represent your ability to perform non-combat tasks of all kinds. See the skills page for a full list of all skills and their purpose in the game.   Your bonus to each skill is equal to your score in the skill’s attribute + your Proficiency in that skill. You start with +0 Proficiency in each skill. Many power schools increase your Proficiency in various combat skills. If multiple power schools set your Proficiency in a combat skill, you only take the highest value. You can also get skill boosts, which you can apply to a general skill to increase your Proficiency in that skill by 2.   You start with 4 skill boosts, which you must apply to different general skills. You gain another skill boost at every odd character level. This means that the total number of skill boosts you have is equal to 4 + half your character level, rounded up. No matter how many skill boosts you apply to a general skill, your Proficiency in that skill can’t increase beyond the maximum given in the table below:           Character Level     Max Proficiency           1 ... 4     +4           5 ... 10     +6           11 ... 16     +8           17 or more     +10      Step 4. Choose your Powers   Powers are a general term for all the special abilities your character has. They cover everything from basic actions to powerful spells. Most of character customizability comes from picking your character’s powers.   Basic powers are shared across all characters. Your character can use all the powers listed in the Basic Powers page. Learned powers are tied to particular power schools and must be learned before you can use them.   All learned powers are part of a power school, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 24 power schools in Forge of Power. See the Power Schools page for a full list of all power schools and their descriptions.   When you create your character, you split your character level between the power schools. For example, if you have a level 5 character, you could choose to put 3 levels in Telekinetic and 2 levels in Duelist, or you could choose to put all 5 levels in Alchemist. Write your level in each power school on your character sheet.   Your character knows a number of powers from each power school equal to your level in that school. Some learned powers are limited by your character’s level and your level in the power’s school. All learned powers are listed as Novice, Veteran, Master, or Epic. To learn a power, you must meet the requirements in the table below:           Tier     Character Level     School Level           Novice     1     1           Veteran     5     3           Master     11     5           Epic     17     7      For example, if you have a level 7 character, you could choose to put 5 levels in the Druid school and 2 levels in the Shapeshifter school. You then learn 5 powers from the Druid school, all of which can be either Novice or Veteran. You also learn 2 powers from the Shapeshifter school, both of which must be Novice.   As another example, if you have a level 9 character, you could choose to put all 9 levels in the Diviner school. You then learn 9 powers from the Diviner school, all of which must be Novice or Veteran.   Step 5. Choose your Ribbons   In addition to powers, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are associated to power schools, and are very similar to powers, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities.   You learn one ribbon at every odd character level. This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You can’t pick ribbons from a power school that you have no levels in, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.   Step 6. Choose your ASIs/Feats   Your character becomes stronger in other ways than simply learning more powers. At every even level, you can choose to either get an Attribute Score Improvement (ASI) or a feat. This means that the total number of ASIs or feats you get is equal to half your character level, rounded down. This represents your character becoming stronger generally, in a way that isn’t tied to any specific power school.   If you choose to get an ASI, you increase your score in one attribute by 1 point, to a maximum of +5.   If you choose to get a feat, you learn one feat from the Feats page.   Step 7. Compute Miscellaneous Stats   You’re now almost finished making your character! The only difficult thing left to do is to write down a few numbers describing various aspects of your character.   Character Level. Your character’s level describes your overall strength. Most characters are between levels 1 and 20, but this isn’t a hard limit. The GM determines what level your character is.   HP. Your hit points (abbreviated as HP) measure how much damage you can take before falling unconscious. Your HP is equal to 20 + Character Level + 2 * Constitution.   AC. Your armor class (abbreviated as AC) measures how difficult you are to hit with physical attacks. Your AC is equal to 10 + Dexterity, though it can be increased by wearing armor.   Initiative. Your Initiative measures how quick you are to react to combat. Your Initiative is equal to Dexterity + Wisdom.   Mana. Your Mana measures how many spells you can cast before running out of energy. Your Mana is equal to Character Level + 2 * Wisdom, to a minimum of 0 Mana.   Spell DC. Your spell difficulty class (abbreviated as Spell DC) measures how difficult your spells are to resist. Your Spell DC is equal to 10 + one of Arcane Magic, Divine Magic, or Innate Magic, whichever is highest.   Step 8. Buy Equipment   Don’t forget to buy equipment to use in your adventures! You start with (100 * your character level) gold pieces (gp). See the weapons and armor pages for stats. More tables for standard adventuring gear and magic items are on the way.   Step 9. Describe your Personality   What your character will choose to do is as important as what your character has the power to do. Every player character has a list of Quirks, which are unique personality traits or flaws that define them. Your Quirks act as a guide to help you roleplay your character, and are useful for Setbacks.   When you make your character, you should write down at least three Quirks that make you stand out. Feel free to add, modify, or remove Quirks at any time as your understand of your character’s personality changes. The categories and random generators below can help give you ideas for your character’s Quirks.   Habits. These describe the obvious character actions that makes your character stand out from the average adventurer.     Weird Skills. These describe your character’s unique skills in strangely specific tasks, things you do better than anyone else.     Bonds. These describe the causes your character cares deeply about, the fundamental beliefs that drive you to act. They also describe the personal connections your character has with family, close friends, loved ones, organizations, or even special items.     Flaws. These describe character flaws that may impede your character and provide a source of narrative conflict.     Step 10. Write your Backstory   The final step in making a character is figuring out how you reached the start of the adventure. You should write down some basic notes about where your character was raised, any previous jobs you’ve held, and how you met the rest of the party. Your backstory is also the perfect place to introduce the NPC contacts that your character knows. The more detail you write, the better your GM will be able to merge this detail with the campaign setting.",

        "title": "Combat Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to combat. See the All Powers page for a list of common actions you can take in combat.   Surprise   If you start combat with a creature that isn’t prepared for an imminent attack, that creature is surprised. A surprised creature cannot use actions during the first round of combat. Creatures that are surprised, that can’t see you, or that otherwise aren’t expecting you to attack are flat-footed against you.   Falling   If there is nothing supporting your character, you fall. You fall up to 5 zones per round. When you fall one or more zones, you take 3d6 damage for each zone you fall, up to a cap of 30d6 damage. The number of dice is reduced by half if you fall onto a soft surface, such as a pile of hay or a pool of water. You land prone if you take any damage from a fall.   Health   Your HP can never go above your maximum HP, and your HP can never go below 0. While your HP is exactly 0, you have the downed condition.   Some effects can give you temporary HP. When you take damage, subtract the damage from your temporary HP first, then subtract any remaining damage from your HP. Multiple sources of temporary HP do not stack, you only keep the highest.   Dying   When you take damage that brings your HP to 0, you gain the dying 1 condition. If this damage was from an enemy’s critical hit or a critical failure on your save, you instead gain the dying 2 condition. While you have the dying condition, you are bleeding out, and you must make a death save at the start of each of your turns.   Death Save   A death save is a Fortitude save against DC 10.      Critical Success   Your dying condition decreases by 2   Success   Your dying condition decreases by 1   Failure   Your dying condition increases by 1   Critical Failure   Your dying condition increases by 2",

        "excerpt": "Blinded  You can’t see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you. You can’t detect anything using vision. You automatically critically fail Perception rolls that require you to be able to see. You’re flat-footed, and you have disadvantage on Perception rolls and attack rolls. Blinded doesn’t stack with dazzled.   Dazzled  Your eyes are overstimulated. You have disadvantage on Perception rolls and attack rolls.   Downed  You are severely injured and are barely able to move. You have the prone and slowed 2 conditions, and you cannot stand up. This condition ends if your HP goes above 0.   Dying  You are bleeding out or otherwise at death’s door. The dying condition is always associated with a value from 1 to 4. If you reach dying 4, you die. At the start of each of your turns while you have this condition, you must make a death save. Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy’s critical hit or a critical failure on your save. This condition ends if your HP goes above 0.   Flat-footed  You’re distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. Attack rolls against you have advantage.   Grabbed  You’re held in place by another creature, giving you the flat-footed and immobilized conditions.   Immobilized  You can’t use any power with the Move trait. If you’re immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against the DC of the effect holding you.   Paralyzed  Your body is frozen in place. You have the flat-footed condition and can’t use any powers. Your senses still function, but only in the areas you can perceive without moving your body.   Prone  You’re lying on the ground. You are flat-footed and have disadvantage on attack rolls. The only Move power you can use while you’re prone is Stride, and you can only move by crawling.   Restrained  You’re tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You have the flat-footed and immobilized conditions, and you can’t use any powers with the Attack or Manipulate traits except to attempt to Escape your bonds.   Slowed  You have fewer actions. The slowed condition is always associated with a value X. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number of actions you regain by X.   Stunned  You’ve become senseless. You can’t act while stunned. The stunned condition is always associated with a value X. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number you regain by X, then reduce X by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned doesn’t stack with slowed.   Unconscious  You’re sleeping, or you’ve been knocked out. You can’t act. You take a -4 penalty to AC and Reflex saves, and you have the blinded and flat-footed conditions. You fall prone and drop items you are wielding or holding. Taking damage, being affected by a spell, or hearing a loud noise usually ends this condition.",

Companion  You have a loyal companion, who might be a human follower, an animal you befriended, or a monster you tamed.

        "title": "Game System",
        "excerpt": "Hello, and welcome to the core rulebook of Forge of Power! I assume that if you’re reading this, you’re already familiar with tabletop RPGs, like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, or Shadowrun. After years of playing these games, I found rules that I wanted to change, new mechanics I wanted to introduce, and interesting ideas I wanted to combine. The result was this system, Forge of Power, that takes all my favorite mechanics from across many systems and merges them together. I think the whole has become more than the sum of its parts.   Versatile Character Creation   Forge of Power tries to maximize the number of options available in character creation. Unlike D&amp;D or Pathfinder, characters in Forge of Power do not choose a single class that determines what your character does. Instead, whenever a character levels up, they can choose a power, a special ability that makes the character much stronger in one way. Powers are organized by theme into collections of related powers, called power schools. Characters are free to mix and match powers from different power schools, letting you pick the perfect combination of powers to realize your character’s theme.   To expand your options even further, power schools have minor abilities called ribbons, which make characters more flavorful or thematic, without greatly affecting your combat power. Ribbons separate out combat strength from roleplaying abilities, making it so every character always has unique strengths to offer both in combat and in social interactions.   Tactical Combat   Like many other roleplaying games, Forge of Power puts a heavy emphasis on combat. The game rules try to make combat as interesting as possible for all characters. All characters, magical and martial, have access to the same number of powers. This means that the fighter will have just as many interesting options to use in combat as the wizard. A lot of effort has been spent trying to balance the various powers against each other. No strategy in combat should ever clearly be much stronger than another.   Setting   Forge of Power was designed around a medieval fantasy world, just like D&amp;D or Pathfinder. Players can expect a setting where brave paladins fight against cunning devils, elven wizards duel against ancient dragons, and adventurers regularly delve into dungeons to slay monsters and recover hidden treasures. That said, the game rules never assume the game uses a specific setting, and groups can play this system in a universe of their choice. Forge of Power can be adapted to completely different settings with only minor modifications. Running a futuristic sci-fi game only requires changing the equipment list to add plasma guns, lightsabers, and spaceships. Running a realistic medieval game is as simple as banning all the “magical” power schools.",

        "title": "Narrative Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are rules that help groups play out interesting stories.  ## Quests  The game is divided into **quests**, each of which has a single well-defined objective. Each quest has a current **Challenge** score, which usually starts at 1. When the party completes a quest, everyone gains XP equal to the quest’s Challenge score.  Whenever the GM adds a complication to the quest, they should increase the Challenge by 1. Especially deadly complications might increase the Challenge by 2 or more.  The party can vote to spend 1 Challenge point to introduce a reasonable plot point that makes the quest easier, such as calling in allies to help, or adding a lucky coincidence that works in their favor. The GM determines whether a proposed plot point would be reasonable. Introducing a plot point can only trivialize the quest if it reduces the Challenge to 0.  ## Inspiration  Every player has a pool of **inspiration** points that they can spend to influence the story. You can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any die roll that any character makes. When you do, you must explain how your character influences the roll. This can be a very simple way, such as yelling a word of moral support, or   You start every session with 1 inspiration point. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration. You can also earn inspiration through Setbacks, see the section below. Unspent inspiration goes away at the end of a session.  ## Setbacks  In books, movies, and shows, we constantly see characters act against their best interests. This makes for interesting, realistic stories of complex, flawed characters. These self-imposed setbacks often act to reinforce the theme of a story. A comedy show relies on exagerrated, silly characters who make humorous mistakes. A grim drama relies on characters with emotional scars that flare up at the worst times.  Forge of Power encourages these stories by compensating players for in-character setbacks. At any time, a player can propose a **Setback**, explaining how a character might act in a way that makes the current quest harder for the entire party. The proposed action has to match the game's theme: if you're running a comedic game, the Setback must be humorous, or if you're running a grimdark game, the Setback must be dark or hurtful. The proposed action must also directly relate to one of the character's Quirks.  The player who controls the character (or the GM, if the character is an NPC) can then choose to accept or reject the proposed Setback. If they accept the Setback, then the proposed action occurs in the game. Both the player who proposed the Setback and the player controlling the character gain 1 inspiration (if you Setback your own character, you gain 2 inspiration). The current quest's Challenge score increases by 1.  Setbacks have a few limitations. First, many Setbacks require an in-character action that can be blocked by other characters. For example, if the reckless character tries to charge into a fight, their party might grab them before they run off. If the action is blocked by other characters, the Setback is cancelled. Second, the same character can't be the cause of a Setback twice in a row. (The same player *can* propose two Setbacks in a row, if they want.) Third, you can't Setback the same Quirk twice in the same game session.",

        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to spells.  ## Spell Properties  Most spells have a **cost** in Mana. You must pay this amount of Mana when you cast the spell. If you run out of Mana, you can pay this cost from your HP instead; if you do, your current and maximum HP both decrease by the remaining cost. If this decreases your maximum HP to 0, you die. Your maximum HP returns to normal on an 8-hour rest.  Most spells have a **range** in feet. If the spell doesn't list a target, it affects one creature you can see within range. If the spell lists an area, the area is centered on a point you can see within range.  ## Heightening Spells  You can **heighten** some spells to increase their effect, at the cost of paying more Mana to use the spell. When you cast a spell, you can choose to pay more Mana than the listed cost, up to a maximum Mana cost of Prof + your level in the spell's school.  If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (per +X Mana)**, then for each X Mana you pay above the base cost, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (total X Mana)**, then if you pay a total of at least X mana, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's descriptions has multiple **Heightened** enties, then all of them apply.",

These abilities are harder to use on more powerful characters, such as player characters and powerful NPC bosses (as determined by the GM). These characters have a +10 bonus to saves, AC, or other defenses against Incapacitation effects.

Basic Powers (3)                                   Draw Item, Interact, Point Out                       Learned Powers (3)                                   Automatic Ballista, Magitech Engine, Metamagic                 Mental       An effect with this trait can alter the target’s mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.                                      Learned Powers (20)                                   Charming Words, Command, Confusion, Dirge of Doom, Dispiriting Taunt, Dominate, Fabricated Truth, Fatal Performance, Fear, Foresight, Inspire Courage, Mind Reading, Phantasmal Killer, Phantom Pain, Project Image, Rage, Soothing Ballad, Suggestion, Synaptic Pulse, Warp Mind                 Minion       A creature for this trait is controlled by another creature.

Misfortune       An effect with this trait detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one Misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple Misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a Fortune effect and Misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.                                           Move       A power with this trait involves moving from one space to another.                           Basic Powers (1)                                   Stride                            Open       These maneuvers work only as the first salvo on your turn. You can use an Open power only if you haven’t used a power with the Attack or Open trait yet this turn.                                      Learned Powers (3)                                   Deadly Aim, Sudden Charge, Whirlwind Strike                 Polymorph       These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can’t be under the effect of more than one Polymorph effect at a time, later Polymorph effects disrupt existing ones. While you are polymorphed, your gear is absorbed into you; the passive abilities of your gear still function, but you can’t activate or use any items.                                      Learned Powers (1)                                   Giant’s Stature                 Positive       Effects with this trait heal living creatures with positive energy, deal radiant damage to undead, or manipulate positive energy.                                      Learned Powers (1)                                   Lay on Hands                 Prediction       Effects with this trait determine what is likely to happen in the near future.

Make a single melee Strike and compare the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two foes, each of whom must be within your melee reach and adjacent to the other.

You gain a +1 bonus to AC, but the only Strike you can make is crane wing attacks. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.   While in Crane Stance, you gain a +5 bonus to die rolls made to jump.                                  Fantastic Leap                              Novice                        You launch yourself through the air at a foe. Make a Stride by jumping. At the end of your jump, you can make a melee Strike, even if you’re in mid-air. You fall to the ground after the Strike. If the distance of your fall is no more than the height of your jump, you take no damage and land upright.                                  Flurry of Blows                              Novice                                       Flourish                                 Make two melee Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your MAP to the Strikes normally.                                  Incredible Movement              Novice                        You move like the wind. Whenever you’re not wearing armor, you gain a bonus to your Speed equal to 5 feet * your Acrobat level.                                  Reactive Pursuit                              Novice                                             Trigger           An adjacent foe moves away from you, and you can reach at least one space adjacent to the foe with a Stride action                                  You keep pace with a retreating foe. You Stride, but you must end your movement adjacent to the triggering enemy. Your move does not trigger reactions from the triggering enemy.                                  Stunning Fist                              Novice                                       Incapacitation                                                      Prerequisites           Flurry of Blows                    Trigger           You target the same creature with two Strikes from your Flurry of Blows, and at least one of the Strikes hits and deals damage.                                  The focused power of your flurry threatens to overwhelm your opponent. Your target must succeed at a Fortitude save against a DC of 10 + Strength + Prof of be stunned 1 (or stunned 3 on a critical failure).                                  Agile Grace              Veteran                        Your graceful moves with agile weapons are beyond compare. Your multiple attack penalty with agile weapons becomes -3 for each Attack power you’ve used so far this turn (rather than -4).                                  Sleeper Hold                              Veteran                                       Attack                    Incapacitation                                                      Requirements           You have a creature grabbed or restrained                                  You pinch crucial points of your target’s nervous system, impeding its ability to function. Attempt to Grapple the creature, with the following success and critical success effects instead of the usual effects.                                   Critical Success           The target falls unconscious for 1 minute, though it remains standing and doesn’t drop what it holds                             Success           The target takes a -1 penalty to Agility until the end of its next turn                                                                 Wall Run                              Veteran                        You defy gravity, traversing vertical planes as easily as the ground. Stride up to your Speed. You must start your movement on a horizontal surface. During this movement, you can run up vertical surfaces, like walls, at your full Speed. If you end the Stride off the ground, you fall after taking your next action or when your turn ends, whichever comes first. If you have Water Step or a similar ability, Wall Run lets you run along flimsy vertical surfaces, as well as vertical liquids, such as a waterfall.                                  Water Step              Veteran                        You can Stride across liquid and surfaces that don’t support your weight. This benefit only lasts during your movement. If you end your movement on a surface that can’t support you, you fall in or it collapses as normal.                                  Whirlwind Strike                              Master                                       Flourish                    Open                                 You attack all nearby adversaries. Make a melee Strike against each enemy within your melee reach. Each attack counts towards your MAP, but do not increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.                                  Enduring Quickness              Epic                        You move as fast and as high as the wind itself. You’re permanently quickened. You can use your extra action only to Stride.                                  Swift River                              Epic                                             Trigger           Your turn ends and you have a penalty to your Speed or are immobilized or slowed                                  You flow like water, avoiding all restraints. End one penalty to your Speed, or end one immobilized or slowed condition affecting you.",

Defensive Roll                              Master                                       Encounter                                                      Trigger           A physical attack would reduce you to 0 HP                                  Dropping into a roll to disperse the force of the blow, you can partially evade a lethal attack and stay conscious. You take half damage from the triggering attack.                                  Impossible Striker              Epic                                             Prerequisites           Sly Striker                                  Your attacks are swift and deadly beyond explanation. Nothing can prevent you from making a sneak attack, even if your opponent can see every blow coming. Instead of dealing the damage from Sly Striker, you can deal your full Sneak Attack damage to a target even if the target isn’t flat-footed.                                  Master Strike                              Epic                                       Incapacitation                                                      Trigger           Your Strike hits a flat-footed creature and deals damage                                  The target attempts a Fortitude save against a DC of 10 + Precision + Prof. It then becomes temporarily immune to your Master Strike for 1 day.

The turret is a creature with 10 * your Inventor level HP, 15 AC, 0 Speed, and the Minion trait. The turret can fire its cannon as a ranged Strike. This deals 2d8 damage, uses your Crafting score as the Weapon Skill, and has a range of 120 feet.

Choose the engine’s element to be one of acid, electricity, ice, fire, magic, or sound. With 1 minute of work, you can set up the engine to perform a single minor effect related to its element, at the GM’s discretion.   When you craft the engine, or as an  power after you craft the engine, you can attach it to a weapon you touch. Strikes with that weapon deal an extra 1d6 damage. A weapon can only have one engine attached to it at a time.",

You explain the details of your plan, which retroactively become fact.

Your plan cannot involve any actions that would require die rolls to succeed.   For example, if you are investigating a dungeon, you could announce that you remembered to bring 100 feet of rope and a grappling hook, as you had anticipated that you might fall down a chasm. Alternatively, if you are in a meeting with the evil mayor, you could announce that you had arranged for the captain of the guard to be wandering by at just the right time, as you had predicted that the mayor would reveal his plan as this exact time. The GM has final say on whether any plan is reasonable.

When you cast this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveals the GM’s best guess among the following outcomes:                  Weal       The results will be good                       Woe       The results will be bad                       Weal and Woe       The results will be a mix of good and bad                       Nothing       There won’t be particularly good or bad results           The GM secretly rolls a d4. On a 1, the result is always “nothing”. If anyone casts Augury again to ask about the same topic, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting, though if circumstances change, it’s possible to get a different result.                                  Guidance                              Novice                                             Range           30 feet                    Duration           Until the start of your next turn                                  You see briefly into the future, granting the target a +1 bonus to one die roll they attempt before the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before rolling, after which the spell ends. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.                                  True Strike                              Novice                                       Fortune                                                      Duration           Until the end of your turn                                  A glimpse into the future ensures your next blow strikes true. The next time you make an attack, roll the attack twice and use the better result. The attack ignores any penalties to the roll.                                  Portent              Novice                        Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish an 8-hour rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any die roll made by you or a creature you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll.   Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish an 8-hour rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

The eye can’t move, but you can see in all directions from that point as if using your normal visual senses.

Choose a particular goal, event, or activity that will occur within 1 week. You learn a cryptic clue or piece of advice that could help with the chosen event, often in the form of a rhyme or omen.

Within that range, you automatically disbelieve all illusions, see invisible creatures, and see the true forms of all polymorphed creatures.

You gain a +2 bonus to Initiative rolls and you aren’t flat-footed against hidden creatures or when flanked. In addition, you gain the following power.   Foresight       Trigger   You defend against a hostile creature or other danger    If the hostile creature or danger forces you to roll dice, you roll twice and uses the higher result, and this power gains the Fortune trait. But if the hostile creature or danger is rolling against you, that hostile creature or danger rolls twice and uses the lower result, and this power gains the Misfortune trait.",

Make a Sorcery roll against the Spell DC of the creature that cast the spell. If you succeed, the target spell immediately ends.

If the next action you use is to cast a spell, you modify the spell in one of the following ways.      Reach   Increase the spell’s range by 30 feet   Silent   The spell doesn’t require verbal components   Widen   If the spell’s area is a burst, increase its radius by 5 feet, or if the spell’s area is a line or cone, increase its length by 10 feet                                  Misty Step                              Novice                                       Spell                    Teleportation                                                      Cost           2 Mana                    Range           30 feet                                  You disappear in a swirl of mist, reappearing in a different location. You and any items you’re wearing or holding teleport to a clear space within range you can see.                                  Dimension Door                              Veteran                                       Spell                    Teleportation                                                      Cost           4 Mana                    Range           120 feet                                  Opening a door that bypasses normal space, you instantly transport yourself and any items you’re wearing or holding from your current space to a clear space within range you can see. If you attempt to bring another creature with you, the power fails.      Heightened (total 5 Mana)   The range increases to 1 mile, and you don’t need to be able to see your destination, as long as you have been there in the past and know its relative location and distance from you                                  Greater Metamagic              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Metamagic                                  You can modify your spells in a broad variety of ways. Your Metamagic power gains the following options.      Conservation   If you spend at least 1 Mana on the spell, one spell you cast next turn costs 1 Mana less   Overwhelming   The spell ignores any resistances to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage   Quickened   The spell takes 2 fewer actions to cast, but the strain involved means you can’t use Metamagic again until you take a long rest                                  Resilient Sphere                              Veteran                                       Force                    Spell                                                      Cost           4 Mana                    Range           30 feet                    Duration           1 minute                                  You create an immobile sphere of force to either trap or protect the target, blocking anything that would pass through the sphere. The sphere has AC 5, Hardness 10, and 40 HP. It’s immune to critical hits and precision damage. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Reflex save, with the following effect.                                   Critical Success           The target disrupts the sphere’s integrity, causing it to collapse entirely                             Success           The sphere functions normally but has only 10 HP instead of 40                             Failure           The sphere has its normal effect                                                        Redirect Gravity                              Master                                       Spell                                                      Cost           7 Mana                    Range           120 feet                    Area           30-foot burst                    Duration           1 minute                                  You change the direction of gravity in the area. Creatures and objects that aren’t secured to the ground immediately fall towards the new direction you designate as down. Rules for falling and fall damage apply as normal. A creature partially inside the area is caught between normal and redirected gravity, and is pulled in both directions at once.                                  Reflect Spell              Master                                             Prerequisites           Counterspell                                  When you use Counterspell to counteract a spell that affects targeted creatures or an area, you can turn that spell’s effect back on its caster. When reflected, the spell affects only the original caster, even if it’s area spell or it would normally affect more than one creature. The original caster can attempt a save and use other defenses against the reflected spell as normal.                                  Metamagic Mastery              Epic                                             Prerequisites           Metamagic                                  Altering your spells doesn’t take any longer than casting them normally. You can use Metamagic as a Free power.                                  Time Stop                              Epic                                       Spell                                                      Cost           10 Mana                                  You temporarily stop time for everything but yourself, allowing you to use several actions in what appears to others to be no time at all. Immediately after using this power, you take 3 turns. Rounds only pass for you, effects specifically targeting or affecting you, and effects you create during the stoppage. All other creatures and objects are invulnerable and can’t be targeted or affected by anything. Once you have finished your turns, time begins to flow again for the rest of the world.",

The target must attempt a Reflex save. The electricity arcs to another creature within 30 feet of the first target, jumps to another creature within 30 feet of that target, and so on. You can end the chain at any point. You can’t target the same creature more than once, and you must be able to see all targets. Roll the damage only once, and apply it to each target. The chain ends if any target critical succeeds at its save.

Make a spell attack. If you hit, you deal 12d10 damage, or twice as much on a critical hit. A creature reduced to 0 HP is reduced to fine powder. An object you hit is destroyed if it would fit within a 10-foot cube, regardless of its HP, unless it’s an artifact or similarly hard to destroy.

You must succeed at a spell attack roll to affect the target, which then takes 10d8 damage and is drained 2.

Each time you Sustain the spell, you must choose a new target to be subject to the same effect. You can’t target the same creature twice during a single casting of this spell, you can’t Sustain this spell multiple times per turn, and you can’t target a creature that lacks a solid form.

Each meteor deals 6d10 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 10-foot burst, then explodes, dealing 14d6 fire damage to all creatures in a 40-foot burst. A creature hit by multiple meteors takes damage only once.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d10, and the fire damage increases by 2d6",

The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn’t change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can change the appearance of your clothing and worn items, but held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance.      Heightened (total 2 Mana)   The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the Auditory trait   Heightened (total 3 Mana)   You can appear as any creature of the same size, even a specific individual as long as you’ve seen them before   Heightened (total 6 Mana)   You can target up to 10 creatures within 30 feet                                  Illusory Object                              Novice                                       Visual                    Spell                                                      Cost           1 Mana                    Range           500 feet                    Area           20-foot burst                    Duration           10 minutes                                  You create an illusory visual image of a stationary object. The entire image must fit within the spell’s area. The object appears to animate naturally, but it doesn’t make sounds or generate smells. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.      Heightened (total 2 Mana)   Your image makes appropriate sounds, generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. The spell gains the Auditory trait. The duration increases to 1 hour.   Heightened (total 5 Mana)   The duration is unlimited.

This makes it hidden from all creatures that rely on sight. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends after that action is completed.      Heightened (total 4 Mana)   The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn’t end if the target uses a hostile action                                  Phantom Pain                              Novice                                       Mental                    Spell                                                      Cost           1 Mana                    Range           30 feet                    Save           Will                    Duration           1 minute                                  Illusory pain wracks the target, dealing 2d4 mental damage and 1d4 persistent mental damage. The target must attempt a Will save.                                   Critical Success           The target is unaffected                             Success           The target takes full initial damage but no persistent damage, and the spell ends immediately                             Failure           The target takes full initial and persistent damage, and the target is sickened 1                             Critical Failure           As failure, but the target is sickened 2                                               Illusory Scene              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Illusory Object                                  Your Illusory Object power can form a scene that includes up to 10 moving creatures or objects. You can have each part of the scene follow a repeating program up to 1 minute long. A creature that interacts with one part of your image only disbelieves that portion.                                  Phantasmal Killer                              Veteran                                       Death                    Emotion                    Fear                    Mental                    Spell                                                      Cost           4 Mana                    Range           120 feet                    Save           Will                                  You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the target. Only the spell’s target can see the killer, though you can see the vague shape of the illusion as it races forth to attack. The effect of the killer is based on the outcome of the target’s Will save.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The damage increases by 1d6 on a success, by 2d6 on a failure, and by 3d6 on a critical failure                                   Critical Success           The target is unaffected                             Success           The target takes 4d6 mental damage and is frightened 1                             Failure           The target takes 8d6 mental damage and is frightened 2                             Critical Failure           The target is so afraid it might die. It must attempt a Fortitude save (with the Incapacitation trait); if the target fails, it dies. On a successful Fortitude save, the target takes 12d6 mental damage, is fleeing until the end of its next turn, and is frightened 4.                                               Shadow Siphon                              Veteran                                       Shadow                    Spell                                                      Cost           5 Mana                    Range           60 feet                    Trigger           A spell or magical effect within range deals damage                                  Exchanging material energy with shadows, you transform the triggering spell into a partially illusory version of itself. Any creatures that would be damaged by the spell instead take only half as much damage, but the spell otherwise works as normal.                                  Project Image                              Master                                       Mental                    Spell                                                      Cost           7 Mana                    Range           30 feet                    Duration           Sustained up to 1 minute                                  You project an illusory image of yourself. You must stay within range of the image, and if at any point you can’t see the image, the spell ends. Whenever you cast a spell, you can cause the spell effect to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the image is an illusion, it isn’t a creature and can’t benefit from spells. The image has the same AC and saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.      Heightened (total 9 Mana)   The maximum duration you can Sustan the spell increases to 10 minutes                                  Weird              Epic                                             Prerequisites           Phantasmal Killer                                  When you spend at least 8 Mana on Phantasmal Killer, the spell targets any number of creatures within range.",
