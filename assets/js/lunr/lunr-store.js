        "excerpt": "Following are rules for interacting with the world.   Resting   The best way to recover from difficult combats is to spend some time resting. The benefits you gain from a rest depend on the length of the rest. You can perform light activity during a rest, such as standing guard, setting up camp, or eating a meal.   If you take a 5-minute rest, you recover the ability to use any Encounter powers you have expended, and your recover all of your Mana. If you take a 1-hour rest, you heal HP equal to half of your maximum HP (this effect can only occur once per day). If you take an 8-hour rest, during which you get at least 5 hours of sleep, you heal to full HP, and you recover the ability to use any Daily powers you have expended.   Inspiration   The GM is encouraged to reward players for good roleplaying with a mechanic called inspiration. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration. You can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any die roll or damage roll that your character makes. This is a Fortune effect.   NPC Attitude   What a non-player character thinks of the party will greatly affect how they interact with the players. NPCs have an attitude towards the party, which is one of the following values:      Helpful   The creature actively wishes to aid you, as long as doing so doesn’t go against its own goals or hurt its quality of life   Friendly   The creature likes you, and will generally agree to simple and easy requests   Indifferent   The creature doesn’t know you, or doesn’t care about you one way or the other   Unfriendly   The creature dislikes and distrusts you, and won’t agree to any of your requests   Hostile   The creature actively wishes to harm you, and might attack you or otherwise try to get in your way   Most NPCs start as indifferent towards the party. A creature you’re fighting is almost always hostile towards you. Aggressive or hurtful actions towards an NPC will greatly worsen their attitude towards you, while generous or kind actions towards an NPC might improve their attitude towards you.",

You must explain to the GM exactly how you’re trying to help, and they determine whether you can Aid your ally. Attempt a die roll (of a type decided by the GM) against DC 20.

You can grab an unattended or stored object, open a door, or produce some similar effect. You might have to attempt a die roll to determine if your Interact power was successful.

Instead of the other creature deciding who takes the next turn, you take the next turn.

The target is no longer hidden to your allies.

Choose a single  power you can use, and designate a trigger. If the trigger occurs before the start of your turn, you can use the chosen power as a reaction.   If you have MAP and your readied power is an Attack, your readied power takes the MAP you had at the end of your turn.                    Repeat                                      Use a  power of your choice.   This lets you use the same  power twice in one turn. For instance, you could Stride twice to move twice as far, Interact twice to interact with more objects, or Sustain twice to keep more spells active at once.                    Seek                                                   Concentrate                Secret                       You scan an area for signs of creatures or objects. If precision is necessary, select a 15-foot burst within line of sight. The GM attempts a single secret Perception roll for you can compares the result to the Stealth DCs of any hidden creatures or objects in the area.                                  Success         You observe the creature or object, making it no longer hidden to you                                           Shove                                                   Attack                                        Target         One creature you can reach                        Make a Strength attack roll against your target’s Strength DC.                           Critical Success         You push your opponent up to 10 feet away from you.                       Success         You push your opponent back 5 feet.

If you’re moving across especially difficult terrain, the GM might ask you make a die roll to determine if your Stride action was successful.                    Strike                                                   Attack                                        Target         One creature within your reach (for a melee attack) or within your weapon’s range (for a ranged attack)                        Make an attack roll against the target’s Defense. The attack roll is a Strength roll for melee weapons or an Agility roll for ranged weapons. Melee weapons with the finesse property let you use Agility instead of Strength for the attack roll.

        "title": "Basic Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are some common rules for the game.   Die Rolls   When you attempt a task that has a chance of failing, you roll dice to determine if your attempt succeeds or fails. All die rolls are associated one stat, called the bonus of the die roll. This stat is usually an attribute or a skill, but can be any number. The die roll is usually referred to by this bonus: if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Strength attribute, then it’s called a Strength roll, or if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Stealth skill, then it’s called a Stealth roll.   To make the die roll, roll 1d20 and add the bonus, and note the result. Your result measures how effectively you attempt the task. Compare this value to the DC set by the GM, using the table below. If you roll a 20 on the die, then your result is one level of success higher than it would normally be. If you roll a 1 on the die, then your result is one level of success lower than it would normally be.   Levels of Success          Result     Values     Description           Critical Success     DC + 10 or more     An exceptionally good result, with bonus positive effects           Success     DC + 0 ... DC + 9     You succeed at the task you were attempting           Failure     DC - 10 ... DC - 1     You fail at the task you were attempting           Critical Failure     DC - 11 or less     An exceptionally bad result, with possible negative effects      Difficulty Classes   The DC (Difficulty Class) of a die roll is usually determined by the GM based on how hard the task seems. The GM is encouraged to used the table below to help them decide the DC. Some abilities call for a die roll against a specific DC. For example, the Strike power calls for a die roll where the DC is your target’s AC.   Sample Difficulties          Difficulty     DC     Description           Simple     10     Something a normal person could do with some effort           Average     15     A task a skilled professional could struggle with           Hard     20     Requires significant training to accomplish           Very Hard     25     Very difficult even for a skilled professional           Extremely Hard     30     Almost impossible except for the greatest masters alive           Impossible     40     At the edge of human achievement, never been done before      Advantage, Disadvantage, and Rerolls   Some effects can give you advantage or disadvantage on a die roll, representing a minor cicumstantial bonus or penalty. When you have advantage on a die roll, you roll the d20 twice and take the higher value. When you have disadvantage on a die roll, you roll the d20 twice and take the lower value. If you have both advantage and disadvantage on a die roll, you only roll the d20 once.   Some effects let you reroll a die roll after it’s made. When you do, repeat the exact same die roll, with the same bonuses, penalties, advantage, and disadvantage as the original. Then, you can pick whether to use the original die roll or the new one.   Turns in Combat   Characters take turns during combat, as who acts first can be very important. When a fight breaks out, everyone involved makes an Initiative roll. Whoever gets the highest result takes the first turn. On your turn, you can use one  power and any number of  powers. After you use a  power once, it counts as a  power for you for the rest of your turn.   At the end of your turn, you pick who takes the next turn, ally or enemy. If you attacked a creature, that creature can choose to Interrupt your choice and take the next turn instead. No matter what, no one can take multiple turns in the same round. The round ends once everyone has taken a turn. The person who took the last turn in the round chooses who starts the next round.   Movement and Zones   When the group needs a precise map of an area, usually for combat, the GM divides the game world into zones. A zone is an abstract area, usually about 30 feet on a side. Every character is in a zone, and multiple character can be in the same zone. You can use the Stride power to move between zones.   Attacks   Some powers represent offensive effects designed to hurt or impede enemies. These are called Attack powers, or just attacks for short. Attacks always involve a die roll, called the attack roll. The attack roll specifies which of the target’s scores to use as the DC, usually Defense or an attribute. The attacker makes this die roll only once, no matter how many targets the attack has. Thus, an attack can hit one target but miss another.   For example, the Strike power is an attack. Imagine that Alice uses the Strike power, slashing at Bob with a longsword. Alice makes a Strength attack roll against Bob’s Defense. If the result of Alice’s attack roll is equal to or higher than Bob’s Defense score, then Alice’s attack is a success, and deals damage as described in the Strike power.",

      {
        "title": "Character Creation",
        "excerpt": "As in other tabletop RPGs, before beginning character creation, you should talk with your group about the general setting and style of your game. Ask your GM what character level you’re starting at, and if they’re using any custom rules. Finally, grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make.   Step 1. Choose your General Theme   The first step in making any character is deciding what you generally want your character to be. Will you be a powerful mage, casting arcane spells that reshape reality? A kung-fu master who can somersault and jump between enemies? A hardened soldier with a variety of weapons, who can tough through any situation?   In this step, you should develop these ideas more, working out the details of what you imagine your character will act and feel like. While you don’t have to write any of this down, you should keep it in mind as you create the rest of your character. The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.   Step 2. Determine Attribute Scores   The next step is to determine your character’s attributes. Characters in Forge of Power have 4 attributes: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Spirit. Your score in each attribute is a single number, which generally ranges from -1 to +5. The average value of an attribute for a normal human is +0. See the Attributes page for a description of each attribute.   Your starting score in each attribute is a number between -1 and +3. You can choose any starting scores you want such that your scores sum to a total to 4. Write the final values of your attributes on your character sheet.   Step 3. Choose your Skills   You now choose what skills your character specializes in. Skills are divided into two broad categories. Combat skills, which are always used during combat, represent your experience with types of weapons or magic. General skills represent your ability to perform non-combat tasks of all kinds. See the Skills page for a full list of all skills and their purpose in the game.   Your bonus to each skill is equal to your score in the skill’s attribute + your Proficiency in that skill. You start with +0 Proficiency in each skill. Many power schools increase your Proficiency in various combat skills. If multiple power schools set your Proficiency in a combat skill, you only take the highest value. You can also get skill boosts, which you can apply to a general skill to increase your Proficiency in that skill by 2.   You start with 4 skill boosts, which you must apply to different general skills. You gain another skill boost at every odd character level. This means that the total number of skill boosts you have is equal to 4 + half your character level, rounded up. No matter how many skill boosts you apply to a general skill, your Proficiency in that skill can’t increase beyond the maximum given in the table below:           Character Level     Max Proficiency           1 ... 4     +4           5 ... 10     +6           11 ... 16     +8           17 or more     +10      Step 4. Choose your Powers   Powers are a general term for all the special abilities your character has. They cover everything from basic actions to powerful spells. Most of character customizability comes from picking your character’s powers.   Basic powers are shared across all characters. Your character can use all the powers listed in the Basic Powers page. Learned powers are tied to particular power schools and must be learned before you can use them.   All learned powers are part of a power school, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 24 power schools in Forge of Power. See the Power Schools page for a full list of all power schools and their descriptions.   When you create your character, you split your character level between the power schools. Write your level in each power school on your character sheet. Your character level and your level in a school determine your tier in the school, as shown in the table below:           Tier     Character Level     School Level           Novice     1     1           Veteran     5     3           Master     11     5           Epic     17     7      Your character knows a number of powers from each power school equal to your level in that school. All learned powers have a tier, which is shown next to the power’s name. To learn a power, you must be at least that tier in the power’s school.   For example, imagine you are creating a level 5 character. You could choose to put 3 levels in Blaster and 2 levels in Duelist. This makes you a Veteran Blaster and a Novice Duelist. You then learn 3 powers from the Blaster school, all of which must be either Novice or Veteran. You also learn 2 powers from the Duelist school, both of which must be Novice.   As another example, imagine you are creating a level 11 character. You could choose to put all 11 levels in the Arcanist school. This makes you a Master Arcanist. You then learn 11 powers from the Arcanist school, all of which must be Novice, Veteran, or Master.   Step 5. Choose your Ribbons   In addition to powers, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are associated to power schools, and are very similar to powers, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities.   You learn one ribbon at every odd character level. This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You can’t pick ribbons from a power school that you have no levels in, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.   Step 6. Choose your ASIs/Feats   Your character becomes stronger in other ways than simply learning more powers. At every even level, you can choose to either get an Attribute Score Improvement (ASI) or a feat. This means that the total number of ASIs or feats you get is equal to half your character level, rounded down. This represents your character becoming stronger generally, in a way that isn’t tied to any specific power school.   If you choose to get an ASI, you increase your score in one attribute by 1 point, to a maximum of +5.   If you choose to get a feat, you learn one feat from the Feats page.   Step 7. Compute Miscellaneous Stats   You’re now almost finished making your character! The only game mechanics task remaining is to write down a few numbers describing various aspects of your character.   Character Level. Your character’s level describes your overall strength. Most characters are between levels 1 and 20, but this isn’t a hard limit. The GM determines what level your character is.   Health. Your Health measures how much damage you can take before falling unconscious. Your Health is equal to 20 + Character Level + 4 * Strength.   Defense. Your Defense measures how well you can avoid, dodge, or parry physical attacks. Your Defense is equal to 8 + Agility.   Perception. Your Perception measures how well you can see, hear, or sense things. Your Perception is equal to your Intellect.   Stat DC. You have a DC for each of your attributes and your Perception. This measures how well you can defend against effects targeting that stat. Your DC for a given stat is equal to 10 + the stat.   Step 8. Buy Equipment   Don’t forget to buy equipment to use in your adventures! You start with (100 * your character level) gold pieces (gp). See the weapons and armor pages for stats. More tables for standard adventuring gear and magic items are on the way.   Step 9. Describe your Personality   What your character will choose to do is as important as what your character has the power to do. Every player character has a list of Quirks, which are unique personality traits or flaws that define them. Your Quirks act as a guide to help you roleplay your character, and are useful for Setbacks.   When you make your character, you should write down at least three Quirks that make you stand out. Feel free to add, modify, or remove Quirks at any time as your understanding of your character’s personality changes. The categories and random generators below can help give you ideas for your character’s Quirks.   Habits. These describe the obvious character actions that makes your character stand out from the average adventurer.     Weird Skills. These describe your character’s unique skills in strangely specific tasks, things you do better than anyone else.     Bonds. These describe the causes your character cares deeply about, the fundamental beliefs that drive you to act. They also describe the personal connections your character has with family, close friends, loved ones, organizations, or even special items.     Flaws. These describe character flaws that may impede your character and provide a source of narrative conflict.     Step 10. Write your Backstory   The final step in making a character is figuring out how you reached the start of the adventure. You should write down some basic notes about where your character was raised, any previous jobs you’ve held, and how you met the rest of the party. Your backstory is also the perfect place to introduce the NPC contacts that your character knows. The more detail you write, the better your GM will be able to merge this detail with the campaign setting.",

        "title": "Combat Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to combat. See the All Powers page for a list of common actions you can take in combat.   Surprise   If you start combat with a creature that isn’t prepared for an imminent attack, that creature is surprised. A surprised creature cannot use actions during the first round of combat. Creatures that are surprised, that can’t see you, or that otherwise aren’t expecting you to attack are flat-footed against you.   Falling   If there is nothing supporting your character, you fall. You fall up to 5 zones per round. When you fall one or more zones, you take 3d6 damage for each zone you fall, up to a cap of 30d6 damage. The number of dice is reduced by half if you fall onto a soft surface, such as a pile of hay or a pool of water. You land prone if you take any damage from a fall.   Health   Your HP can never go above your maximum HP, and your HP can never go below 0. While your HP is exactly 0, you have the downed condition.   Some effects can give you temporary HP. When you take damage, subtract the damage from your temporary HP first, then subtract any remaining damage from your HP. Multiple sources of temporary HP do not stack, you only keep the highest.   Dying   When you take damage that brings your HP to 0, you gain the dying 1 condition. If this damage was from an enemy’s critical hit or a critical failure on your save, you instead gain the dying 2 condition. While you have the dying condition, you are bleeding out, and you must make a death save at the start of each of your turns.   Death Save   A death save is a Fortitude save against DC 10.      Critical Success   Your dying condition decreases by 2   Success   Your dying condition decreases by 1   Failure   Your dying condition increases by 1   Critical Failure   Your dying condition increases by 2",

You automatically critically fail Perception rolls that require you to be able to see. You’re flat-footed, and you have disadvantage on Perception rolls and attack rolls. Blinded doesn’t stack with dazzled.   Dazzled  Your eyes are overstimulated. You have disadvantage on Perception rolls and attack rolls.   Downed  You are severely injured and are barely able to move. You have the prone and slowed 2 conditions, and you cannot stand up. This condition ends if your HP goes above 0.   Dying  You are bleeding out or otherwise at death’s door. The dying condition is always associated with a value from 1 to 4. If you reach dying 4, you die. At the start of each of your turns while you have this condition, you must make a death save. Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy’s critical hit or a critical failure on your save. This condition ends if your HP goes above 0.   Flat-footed  You’re distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. Attack rolls against you have advantage.   Grabbed  You’re held in place by another creature, giving you the flat-footed and immobilized conditions.   Immobilized  You can’t use any power with the Move trait. If you’re immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against the DC of the effect holding you.   Paralyzed  Your body is frozen in place. You have the flat-footed condition and can’t use any powers. Your senses still function, but only in the areas you can perceive without moving your body.   Prone  You’re lying on the ground. You are flat-footed and have disadvantage on attack rolls. The only Move power you can use while you’re prone is Stride, and you can only move by crawling.   Restrained  You’re tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You have the flat-footed and immobilized conditions, and you can’t use any powers with the Attack or Manipulate traits except to attempt to Escape your bonds.   Slowed  You have fewer actions. The slowed condition is always associated with a value X. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number of actions you regain by X.   Stunned  You’ve become senseless. You can’t act while stunned. The stunned condition is always associated with a value X. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number you regain by X, then reduce X by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned doesn’t stack with slowed.   Unconscious  You’re sleeping, or you’ve been knocked out. You can’t act. You take a -4 penalty to AC and Reflex saves, and you have the blinded and flat-footed conditions. You fall prone and drop items you are wielding or holding. Taking damage, being affected by a spell, or hearing a loud noise usually ends this condition.",

Companion  You have a loyal companion, who might be a human follower, an animal you befriended, or a monster you tamed.

        "excerpt": "Hello, and welcome to the core rulebook of Forge of Power! I assume that if you’re reading this, you’re already familiar with tabletop RPGs, like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, or Shadowrun. After years of playing these games, I found rules that I wanted to change, new mechanics I wanted to introduce, and interesting ideas I wanted to combine. The result was this system, Forge of Power, that takes all my favorite mechanics from across many systems and merges them together. I think the whole has become more than the sum of its parts.   Versatile Character Creation   Forge of Power tries to maximize the number of options available in character creation. Unlike D&amp;D or Pathfinder, characters in Forge of Power do not choose a single class that determines what your character does. Instead, whenever a character levels up, they can choose a power, a special ability that makes the character much stronger in one way. Powers are organized by theme into collections of related powers, called power schools. Characters are free to mix and match powers from different power schools, letting you pick the perfect combination of powers to realize your character’s theme.   To expand your options even further, power schools have minor abilities called ribbons, which make characters more flavorful or thematic, without greatly affecting your combat power. Ribbons separate out combat strength from roleplaying abilities, making it so every character always has unique strengths to offer both in combat and in social interactions.   Tactical Combat   Like many other roleplaying games, Forge of Power puts a heavy emphasis on combat. The game rules try to make combat as interesting as possible for all characters. All characters, magical and martial, have access to the same number of powers. This means that the fighter will have just as many interesting options to use in combat as the wizard. A lot of effort has been spent trying to balance the various powers against each other. No strategy in combat should ever clearly be much stronger than another.   Setting   Forge of Power was designed around a medieval fantasy world, just like D&amp;D or Pathfinder. Players can expect a setting where brave paladins fight against cunning devils, elven wizards duel against ancient dragons, and adventurers regularly delve into dungeons to slay monsters and recover hidden treasures. That said, the game rules never assume the game uses a specific setting, and groups can play this system in a universe of their choice. Forge of Power can be adapted to completely different settings with only minor modifications. Running a futuristic sci-fi game only requires changing the equipment list to add plasma guns, lightsabers, and spaceships. Running a realistic medieval game is as simple as banning all the “magical” power schools.",

      {
        "title": "Narrative Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are rules that help groups play out interesting stories.  ## Quests  The game is divided into **quests**, each of which has a single well-defined objective. Each quest has a current **Challenge** score, which usually starts at 1. When the party completes a quest, everyone gains XP equal to the quest’s Challenge score.  Whenever the GM adds a complication to the quest, they should increase the Challenge by 1. Especially deadly complications might increase the Challenge by 2 or more.  The party can vote to spend 1 Challenge point to introduce a reasonable plot point that makes the quest easier, such as calling in allies to help, or adding a lucky coincidence that works in their favor. The GM determines whether a proposed plot point would be reasonable. Introducing a plot point can only trivialize the quest if it reduces the Challenge to 0.  ## Inspiration  Every player has a pool of **inspiration** points that they can spend to influence the story. You can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any die roll that any character makes. When you do, you must explain how your character somehow influences the roll. Even just yelling a few words of moral support counts.  You start every session with 1 inspiration point. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration. You can also earn inspiration through Setbacks (see below). Unspent inspiration goes away at the end of a session.  ## Setbacks  In books, movies, and shows, we constantly see characters act against their best interests. This makes for interesting, realistic stories of complex, flawed characters. These self-imposed setbacks often act to reinforce the theme of a story. A comedy show relies on exagerrated, silly characters who make humorous mistakes. A grim drama relies on characters with emotional scars that flare up at the worst times.  Forge of Power encourages these stories by compensating players for in-character setbacks. At any time, a player can propose a **Setback**, explaining how a character might act in a way that makes the current quest harder for the entire party. The proposed action has to match the game's theme: if you're running a comedic game, the Setback must be humorous, or if you're running a grimdark game, the Setback must be dark or hurtful. The proposed action must also directly relate to one of the character's Quirks.  The player who controls the character (or the GM, if the character is an NPC) can then choose to accept or reject the proposed Setback. If they accept the Setback, then the proposed action occurs in the game. Both the player who proposed the Setback and the player controlling the character gain 1 inspiration (if you Setback your own character, you gain 2 inspiration). The current quest's Challenge score increases by 1.  Setbacks have a few limitations. First, many Setbacks require an in-character action that can be blocked by other characters. For example, if the reckless character tries to charge into a fight, their party might grab them before they run off. If the action is blocked by other characters, the Setback is cancelled. Second, the same character can't be the cause of a Setback twice in a row. (The same player *can* propose two Setbacks in a row, if they want.) Third, you can't Setback the same Quirk twice in the same game session.",

        "title": "Spell Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to spells.  ## Casting Spells  A power with the [[Spell]] trait is called a **spell**. All spells implicitly have the [[Concentrate]] and [[Manipulate]] traits. Using such a power is called **casting** the spell. Casting a spell requires speaking a command phrase and making hand gestures, which usually make it obvious that you are casting a spell.  Casting spells requires an **arcane focus**, which is a handheld item you use to channel your magic. You can meditate or focus for 1 hour to designate an item as your arcane focus. Bonding to a new arcane focus severs your connection with your previous focus. You can pick any item as your arcane focus - a staff, a book, a crystal gem, a sword, or so on. You must hold your arcane focus in one hand while casting a spell or using the {Sustain} power.  ## Spell Properties  All spells have a **cost** in Mana. You must pay this amount of Mana when you cast the spell. If you don't have enough Mana, you can't cast the spell. Some effects reduce the cost of a spell. You must always spend at least 1 Mana when you cast a spell, or at least 0 Mana if the spell has the [[Cantrip]] trait.  Some spells have a **range** in feet. If the spell doesn't list a target or an area, it targets one creature you can see within range.  Some spells have an **area**. If the spell lists a range, the area is centered on a point you can see within range, otherwise the area is centered on you. If the spell doesn't list a target, it targets all creatures in the area.  Some spells have a **duration**. When the duration ends, the spell's effect completely ends. The world returns to its normal state, as if the spell hadn't been cast. Any permanent changes the spell made to the world, such as inflicting or healing damage, don't disappear when the spell ends. You can't end an ongoing spell early unless it specifies that in its duration.  ## Heightening Spells  You can **heighten** some spells to increase their effect, at the cost of paying more Mana to use the spell. When you cast a spell, you can choose to pay more Mana than the listed cost, up to a limit of half your character's total Mana.  If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (per +X Mana)**, then for each X Mana you pay above the base cost, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (total X Mana)**, then if you pay a total of at least X mana, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's descriptions has multiple **Heightened** enties, then all of them apply.  ## Customizing Spells  Spells are flexible effects, and the caster has significant leeway in choosing how the spell is expressed. A powerful spellcaster who conjures vast firestorms could use that same spell to light a single candle. You can reduce the area, range, duration, or damage of a spell as much as you want when you cast the spell, though the cost stays the same. Ask your GM what other parameters you can change for a given spell. Once you cast the spell, you no longer have direct control over the magic, so you have to pick any changes when you cast the spell.  Players are encouraged to describe their spells differently than how they're described in the rules. For example, instead of describing your {Fireball} spell as an explosion of flames, you could describe it as a flash of lightning, an intense wave of radiation, or as briefly transporting targets to a Hell dimension. Your unique description for your spell is called the spell's Trappings.  Trappings shouldn't change how a spell functions in normal circumstances. The GM might say that Trappings change how a spell acts in unusual circumstances, such as a flash of lightning being more effective than a fireball when the target is underwater. Creatively using spells is cool, and should be encouraged.  ## Arcane Backgrounds  When you first reach Novice tier in any power school that has spells, you gain one arcane background from the list below. Your arcane background determines your Magic and Mana stats, and gives you unique extra bonuses.  ### Cleric  You cast magic spells through faith and devotion to your religion.  ***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Spirit.  ***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.  ***Bonuses.*** When you reach Novice tier in a Priest power school, choose one spell in that school as your **domain spell** in that school. The cost of your domain spell is reduced by 1.  ### Psion  You cast magic spells through intense focus and strength of will.  ***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Spirit.  ***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.  ***Bonuses.*** You don't need an arcane focus to cast or sustain spells.  ### Warlock  You cast magic spells through a bargain with an extraplanar entity.  ***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Intellect.  ***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 1-hour rest.  ***Bonuses.*** When you finish an 8-hour rest, you can try to bargain with your patron for more power. Make a Spirit roll against DC 15. On a success, your Mana stat increases by 4. On a failure, your Mana stat decreases by 4. Both effects end when you complete another 8-hour rest.  ### Wizard  You cast magic spells through intense study and memorization.  ***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Intellect.  ***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.  ***Bonuses.*** When you reach Novice tier in a Mage power school, you learn one [[Cantrip]] power from that school. This power doesn't count towards the normal limit of powers you know in that school.",

If multiple Misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a Fortune effect and Misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

You can automatically apply the effects of the Shove action (including the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit).

The only Strikes you can make are falling stone unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage and have the forceful and unarmed traits.   While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +2 bonus to Toughness, but you take a -2 penalty to Agility.

You gain a +1 bonus to AC, but the only Strike you can make is crane wing attacks. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.   While in Crane Stance, you gain a +5 bonus to die rolls made to jump.                                  Fantastic Leap                              Novice                        You launch yourself through the air at a foe. Make a Stride by jumping. At the end of your jump, you can make a melee Strike, even if you’re in mid-air. You fall to the ground after the Strike. If the distance of your fall is no more than the height of your jump, you take no damage and land upright.                                  Flurry of Blows                              Novice                                       Flourish                                 Make two melee Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your MAP to the Strikes normally.                                  Incredible Movement              Novice                        You move like the wind. Whenever you’re not wearing armor, you gain a bonus to your Speed equal to 5 feet * your Acrobat level.                                  Reactive Pursuit                              Novice                                             Trigger           An adjacent foe moves away from you, and you can reach at least one space adjacent to the foe with a Stride action                                  You keep pace with a retreating foe. You Stride, but you must end your movement adjacent to the triggering enemy. Your move does not trigger reactions from the triggering enemy.                                  Stunning Fist                              Novice                                       Incapacitation                                                      Prerequisites           Flurry of Blows                    Trigger           You target the same creature with two Strikes from your Flurry of Blows, and at least one of the Strikes hits and deals damage.                                  The focused power of your flurry threatens to overwhelm your opponent. Your target must succeed at a Fortitude save against a DC of 10 + Strength + Prof of be stunned 1 (or stunned 3 on a critical failure).                                  Agile Grace              Veteran                        Your graceful moves with agile weapons are beyond compare. Your multiple attack penalty with agile weapons becomes -3 for each Attack power you’ve used so far this turn (rather than -4).                                  Sleeper Hold                              Veteran                                       Attack                    Incapacitation                                                      Requirements           You have a creature grabbed or restrained                                  You pinch crucial points of your target’s nervous system, impeding its ability to function. Attempt to Grapple the creature, with the following success and critical success effects instead of the usual effects.                                   Critical Success           The target falls unconscious for 1 minute, though it remains standing and doesn’t drop what it holds                             Success           The target takes a -1 penalty to Agility until the end of its next turn                                                                 Wall Run                              Veteran                        You defy gravity, traversing vertical planes as easily as the ground. Stride up to your Speed. You must start your movement on a horizontal surface. During this movement, you can run up vertical surfaces, like walls, at your full Speed. If you end the Stride off the ground, you fall after taking your next action or when your turn ends, whichever comes first. If you have Water Step or a similar ability, Wall Run lets you run along flimsy vertical surfaces, as well as vertical liquids, such as a waterfall.                                  Water Step              Veteran                        You can Stride across liquid and surfaces that don’t support your weight. This benefit only lasts during your movement. If you end your movement on a surface that can’t support you, you fall in or it collapses as normal.                                  Whirlwind Strike                              Master                                       Flourish                    Open                                 You attack all nearby adversaries. Make a melee Strike against each enemy within your melee reach. Each attack counts towards your MAP, but do not increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.                                  Enduring Quickness              Epic                        You move as fast and as high as the wind itself. You’re permanently quickened. You can use your extra action only to Stride.                                  Swift River                              Epic                                             Trigger           Your turn ends and you have a penalty to your Speed or are immobilized or slowed                                  You flow like water, avoiding all restraints. End one penalty to your Speed, or end one immobilized or slowed condition affecting you.",

You explain the details of your plan, which retroactively become fact. You cannot change any established events in the story, and your plan must be something that you could have reasonably prepared within the past 24 hours. Your plan cannot involve any actions that would require die rolls to succeed.   For example, if you are investigating a dungeon, you could announce that you remembered to bring 100 feet of rope and a grappling hook, as you had anticipated that you might fall down a chasm. Alternatively, if you are in a meeting with the evil mayor, you could announce that you had arranged for the captain of the guard to be wandering by at just the right time, as you had predicted that the mayor would reveal his plan as this exact time. The GM has final say on whether any plan is reasonable.

Quick Draw                              Novice                        You draw your weapon and attack with the same motion. You Interact to draw a weapon, then Strike with that weapon.                                  Sneak Attack              Novice                        When your enemy can’t properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the flat-footed condition, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. The weapon you Strike with must be a ranged weapon, or must have the agile or finesse trait.   As your level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.                                  Unbalancing Blow              Novice                        Interweaving your most powerful attacks in a graceful flow, you temporarily unbalance your foes. Whenever your Strike is a critical hit and deals damage, the target is flat-footed against your attacks until the end of your next turn.                                  Nimble Roll              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Nimble Dodge                                  You throw yourself into a roll to escape imminent danger. You can use Nimble Dodge before attempting a Reflex save in addition to its original trigger. If you do, the circumstance bonus applies to your Reflex save against the triggering effect.   When you use Nimble Dodge and the triggering attack fails or criticalls fails, or when you succeed or critically succeed at the saving throw, you can also Stride up to 10 feet as part of the reaction. If you do, the reaction gains the Move trait.                                  Sly Striker              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Sneak Attack                                  Your attacks deal more damage, even against creatures that aren’t flat-footed. When you succeed or critically succeed at a Strike against a creature that isn’t flat-footed, you also deal 1d6 precision damage. This applies only if you’re using a weapon you could Sneak Attack with. This damage increases to 2d6 at 14th level.                                  Defensive Roll                              Master                                       Encounter                                                      Trigger           A physical attack would reduce you to 0 HP                                  Dropping into a roll to disperse the force of the blow, you can partially evade a lethal attack and stay conscious. You take half damage from the triggering attack.                                  Impossible Striker              Epic                                             Prerequisites           Sly Striker                                  Your attacks are swift and deadly beyond explanation. Nothing can prevent you from making a sneak attack, even if your opponent can see every blow coming. Instead of dealing the damage from Sly Striker, you can deal your full Sneak Attack damage to a target even if the target isn’t flat-footed.                                  Master Strike                              Epic                                       Incapacitation                                                      Trigger           Your Strike hits a flat-footed creature and deals damage                                  The target attempts a Fortitude save against a DC of 10 + Precision + Prof. It then becomes temporarily immune to your Master Strike for 1 day.                                   Critical Success           The target is unaffected                             Success           The target takes a -2 penalty to Strength until the end of your next turn                             Failure           The target is paralyzed for 4 rounds                             Critical Failure           The target is paralyzed for 4 rounds, knocked unconscious for 2 hours, or killed (your choice)",

Make a spell attack against the target. On a hit, you deal 3d8 acid damage plus 1d6 persistent acid damage. On a critical hit, double the initial damage, but not the persistent damage.      Heightened (per +2 Mana)   The intial damage increases by 2d8, and the persistant acid damage increases by 1d6                                  Bolt                              Novice                                       Attack                    Cantrip                    Spell                                                      Range           60 feet                                  You fire a bolt of damaging magical energies that impacts with violent force. Make a Magic attack roll against the target’s defense.

When you cast a spell, if the spell deals damage and doesn’t have a duration, you gain a bonus to that spell’s damage equal to your Blaster level.

It automatically hits and deals 1d4+1 force damage to the target.                                  Sound Burst                              Novice                                       Spell                    Sonic                                                      Cost           2 Mana                    Range           30 feet                    Area           10-foot burst                    Save           Fortitude                                  A cacophonous noise blasts out, dealing 2d10 sonic damage.

Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The damage increases by 1d12                                  Chain Lightning                              Master                                       Electricity                    Spell                                                      Cost           6 Mana                    Range           30 feet                    Save           Reflex                                  You discharge a powerful bolt of lightning at the target, dealing 8d12 electricity damage. The target must attempt a Reflex save. The electricity arcs to another creature within 30 feet of the first target, jumps to another creature within 30 feet of that target, and so on. You can end the chain at any point. You can’t target the same creature more than once, and you must be able to see all targets. Roll the damage only once, and apply it to each target. The chain ends if any target critical succeeds at its save.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The damage increases by 1d12                                  Disintegrate                              Master                                       Attack                    Spell                                                      Cost           6 Mana                    Range           120 feet                                  You fire a green ray at your target. Make a spell attack. If you hit, you deal 12d10 damage, or twice as much on a critical hit. A creature reduced to 0 HP is reduced to fine powder. An object you hit is destroyed if it would fit within a 10-foot cube, regardless of its HP, unless it’s an artifact or similarly hard to destroy.                                  Polar Ray                              Master                                       Attack                    Cold                    Spell                                                      Cost           8 Mana                    Range           120 feet                                  You fire a blue-white ray of freezing air and swirling sleet from your finger that can chill your target to the bones. You must succeed at a spell attack roll to affect the target, which then takes 10d8 damage and is drained 2.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The damage increases by 2d8                                  Implosion                              Epic                                       Spell                                                      Cost           9 Mana                    Range           30 feet                    Save           Fortitude                    Duration           Sustained, up to 1 minute                                  You crush the target by causing it to collapse in on itself, dealing 75 damage. Each time you Sustain the spell, you must choose a new target to be subject to the same effect. You can’t target the same creature twice during a single casting of this spell, you can’t Sustain this spell multiple times per turn, and you can’t target a creature that lacks a solid form.                                  Meteor Swarm                              Epic                                       Spell                                                      Cost           9 Mana                    Range           500 feet                    Save           Reflex                                  You call down four meteors that explode in fiery blasts. Each meteor deals 6d10 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 10-foot burst, then explodes, dealing 14d6 fire damage to all creatures in a 40-foot burst. A creature hit by multiple meteors takes damage only once.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d10, and the fire damage increases by 2d6",

The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn’t change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can change the appearance of your clothing and worn items, but held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance.      Heightened (total 2 Mana)   The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the Auditory trait   Heightened (total 3 Mana)   You can appear as any creature of the same size, even a specific individual as long as you’ve seen them before   Heightened (total 6 Mana)   You can target up to 10 creatures within 30 feet                                  Illusory Object                              Novice                                       Visual                    Spell                                                      Cost           1 Mana                    Range           500 feet                    Area           20-foot burst                    Duration           10 minutes                                  You create an illusory visual image of a stationary object. The entire image must fit within the spell’s area. The object appears to animate naturally, but it doesn’t make sounds or generate smells. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.      Heightened (total 2 Mana)   Your image makes appropriate sounds, generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. The spell gains the Auditory trait. The duration increases to 1 hour.   Heightened (total 5 Mana)   The duration is unlimited.

This makes it hidden from all creatures that rely on sight. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends after that action is completed.      Heightened (total 4 Mana)   The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn’t end if the target uses a hostile action                                  Phantom Pain                              Novice                                       Mental                    Spell                                                      Cost           1 Mana                    Range           30 feet                    Save           Will                    Duration           1 minute                                  Illusory pain wracks the target, dealing 2d4 mental damage and 1d4 persistent mental damage. The target must attempt a Will save.                                   Critical Success           The target is unaffected                             Success           The target takes full initial damage but no persistent damage, and the spell ends immediately                             Failure           The target takes full initial and persistent damage, and the target is sickened 1                             Critical Failure           As failure, but the target is sickened 2                                               Illusory Scene              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Illusory Object                                  Your Illusory Object power can form a scene that includes up to 10 moving creatures or objects. You can have each part of the scene follow a repeating program up to 1 minute long. A creature that interacts with one part of your image only disbelieves that portion.                                  Phantasmal Killer                              Veteran                                       Death                    Emotion                    Fear                    Mental                    Spell                                                      Cost           4 Mana                    Range           120 feet                    Save           Will                                  You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the target. Only the spell’s target can see the killer, though you can see the vague shape of the illusion as it races forth to attack. The effect of the killer is based on the outcome of the target’s Will save.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The damage increases by 1d6 on a success, by 2d6 on a failure, and by 3d6 on a critical failure                                   Critical Success           The target is unaffected                             Success           The target takes 4d6 mental damage and is frightened 1                             Failure           The target takes 8d6 mental damage and is frightened 2                             Critical Failure           The target is so afraid it might die. It must attempt a Fortitude save (with the Incapacitation trait); if the target fails, it dies. On a successful Fortitude save, the target takes 12d6 mental damage, is fleeing until the end of its next turn, and is frightened 4.

You must stay within range of the image, and if at any point you can’t see the image, the spell ends. Whenever you cast a spell, you can cause the spell effect to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the image is an illusion, it isn’t a creature and can’t benefit from spells. The image has the same AC and saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.

If the next action you use is to cast a spell, you modify the spell in one of the following ways.      Reach   Increase the spell’s range by 30 feet   Silent   The spell doesn’t require verbal components   Widen   If the spell’s area is a burst, increase its radius by 5 feet, or if the spell’s area is a line or cone, increase its length by 10 feet                                  Misty Step                              Novice                                       Spell                    Teleportation                                                      Cost           2 Mana                    Range           30 feet                                  You disappear in a swirl of mist, reappearing in a different location. You and any items you’re wearing or holding teleport to a clear space within range you can see.

If you attempt to bring another creature with you, the power fails.      Heightened (total 5 Mana)   The range increases to 1 mile, and you don’t need to be able to see your destination, as long as you have been there in the past and know its relative location and distance from you                                  Greater Metamagic              Veteran                                             Prerequisites           Metamagic                                  You can modify your spells in a broad variety of ways. Your Metamagic power gains the following options.      Conservation   If you spend at least 1 Mana on the spell, one spell you cast next turn costs 1 Mana less   Overwhelming   The spell ignores any resistances to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage   Quickened   The spell takes 2 fewer actions to cast, but the strain involved means you can’t use Metamagic again until you take a long rest                                  Resilient Sphere                              Veteran                                       Force                    Spell                                                      Cost           4 Mana                    Range           30 feet                    Duration           1 minute                                  You create an immobile sphere of force to either trap or protect the target, blocking anything that would pass through the sphere. The sphere has AC 5, Hardness 10, and 40 HP. It’s immune to critical hits and precision damage. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Reflex save, with the following effect.                                   Critical Success           The target disrupts the sphere’s integrity, causing it to collapse entirely                             Success           The sphere functions normally but has only 10 HP instead of 40                             Failure           The sphere has its normal effect                                                        Redirect Gravity                              Master                                       Spell                                                      Cost           7 Mana                    Range           120 feet                    Area           30-foot burst                    Duration           1 minute                                  You change the direction of gravity in the area. Creatures and objects that aren’t secured to the ground immediately fall towards the new direction you designate as down. Rules for falling and fall damage apply as normal. A creature partially inside the area is caught between normal and redirected gravity, and is pulled in both directions at once.                                  Reflect Spell              Master                                             Prerequisites           Counterspell                                  When you use Counterspell to counteract a spell that affects targeted creatures or an area, you can turn that spell’s effect back on its caster. When reflected, the spell affects only the original caster, even if it’s area spell or it would normally affect more than one creature. The original caster can attempt a save and use other defenses against the reflected spell as normal.

You can use Metamagic as a Free power.

Immediately after using this power, you take 3 turns. Rounds only pass for you, effects specifically targeting or affecting you, and effects you create during the stoppage. All other creatures and objects are invulnerable and can’t be targeted or affected by anything. Once you have finished your turns, time begins to flow again for the rest of the world.

When you cast this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveals the GM’s best guess among the following outcomes:                  Weal       The results will be good                       Woe       The results will be bad                       Weal and Woe       The results will be a mix of good and bad                       Nothing       There won’t be particularly good or bad results           The GM secretly rolls a d4. On a 1, the result is always “nothing”. If anyone casts Augury again to ask about the same topic, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting, though if circumstances change, it’s possible to get a different result.

The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before rolling, after which the spell ends. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

The next time you make an attack, roll the attack twice and use the better result. The attack ignores any penalties to the roll.                                  Portent              Novice                        Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish an 8-hour rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any die roll made by you or a creature you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll.   Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish an 8-hour rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

This puts out small fires and freezes small bodies of water. This effect isn’t powerful enough to affect large objects, creatures, or magical heat sources.      Heightened (total 2 Mana)   This power gains the Attack trait and targets all creatures in the area that are partially submerged in water. Make a Magic attack roll against your target’s Agility DC. On a success, your target takes 2d8 damage and is restrained until the end of your next turn. On a failure, your target takes 1d8 damage and is slowed until the end of your next turn.

The flame doesn’t require fuel and doesn’t burn you. You can touch an object to rapidly heat it up or to set fire to a flammable object. The flame isn’t large enough to be effective as an attack.      Heightened (total 1 Mana)   This power gains a range of 30 feet, and targets an unattended object you can see within range. The flame does burn your target, quickly setting fire to a flammable target.   Heightened (total 2 Mana)   This power gains a range of 60 feet, gains an area of a 20-foot burst, and targets all unattended objects in the area                                  Tremorsense              Ribbon                                             Range           30 feet                                  You perceive all creatures and objects within range that you are connected to by a path of a solid material. If this material is entirely hard earth or stone, then your sense is as accurate as vision or touch. Otherwise, your sense is less accurate, and you have disadvantage on rolls that depend on perceiving a target. Your sense doesn’t work at all through soft materials, such as sand or water.",
