        "excerpt": "Following are rules for interacting with the world.   Resting   The best way to recover from difficult combats is to spend some time resting. The benefits you gain from a rest depend on the length of the rest. You can perform light activity during a rest, such as standing guard, setting up camp, or eating a meal. Stressful activies, including combat or enduring harsh weather, interrupt a rest.   If you take a 5-minute rest, you recover the ability to use any Encounter powers you have expended. If you take a 1-hour rest, you heal an amount equal to half of your Health stat (this effect cannot occur again until you take an 8-hour rest). If you take an 8-hour rest, during which you get at least 5 hours of sleep, you heal an amount equal to your Health stat, and you recover the ability to use any Daily powers you have expended.   Carrying Capacity   Your carrying capacity is determined by your Strength and your Size. This value represents the maximum weight you can lift without too much trouble. You can lift up to twice this weight for a short time.   To compute your carrying capacity, plug your Strength into the table below. If your Size is greater than +0, multiply the result by 4 for each +1. If your Size is less than +0, divide the result by 4 for each -1.           Strength     Carrying Capacity      -550 lbs   -457 lbs   -366 lbs   -276 lbs   -187 lbs   +0100 lbs   +1110 lbs   +2130 lbs   +3150 lbs   +4170 lbs   +5200 lbs   +6230 lbs   +7260 lbs   +8300 lbs   +9350 lbs   +10400 lbs   NPC Attitude   What a non-player character thinks of the party will greatly affect how they interact with the players. NPCs have an attitude towards the party, which is one of the following values:      Helpful   The creature actively wishes to aid you, as long as doing so doesn’t go against its own goals or hurt its quality of life   Friendly   The creature likes you, and will generally agree to simple and easy requests   Indifferent   The creature doesn’t know you, or doesn’t care about you one way or the other   Unfriendly   The creature dislikes and distrusts you, and won’t agree to any of your requests   Hostile   The creature actively wishes to harm you, and might attack you or otherwise try to get in your way   Most NPCs start as indifferent towards the party. A creature you’re fighting is almost always hostile towards you. Aggressive or hurtful actions towards an NPC will greatly worsen their attitude towards you, while generous or kind actions towards an NPC might improve their attitude towards you.",

The task but be something you could reasonably help with, must involve a die roll, and must be completed before the start of your next turn. You must explain to the GM exactly how you’re trying to help, and they determine whether you can Aid your ally. Attempt a die roll (of a type decided by the GM) against DC 20.                            Success         Your ally has advantage on the roll                        Critical Failure         Your ally has disadvantage on the roll                              Interact                                                         Manipulate               You use your hand or hands to manipulate an object or the terrain. You draw or stow any number of items that are secured in easily accessible locations, such as a weapon in its holster or a potion in a belt pouch. Alternatively, you can grab an unattended or stored object, open a door, or produce some similar effect. If you’re interacting with the external world, you might have to attempt a die roll to determine if your Interact power was successful.                       Interrupt                                                           Trigger         A creature ends its turn              Requirements         That creature targeted you with an Attack power on its turn, you haven’t taken a turn yet this round, and you are not surprised                  You interrupt the normal turn order. Instead of the triggering creature deciding who takes the next turn, you take the next turn.                       Point Out                                                         Auditory              Manipulate              Visual                                Requirements         A creature you can see is hidden to one or more of your allies                  You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies, gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally. The target is no longer hidden to your allies.                       Repeat                                          Use a  power of your choice.   This lets you use the same  power twice in one turn. For instance, you could Stride twice to move twice as far, Interact twice to interact with more objects, or Sustain twice to keep more spells active at once.                       Seek                                                         Concentrate                                Area         A 15-foot burst you can see              Target         All hidden creatures or objects in the area                  Make a Intellect+Notice roll against your target’s Agility+Stealth DC.

Critical Success         You push your target up to 10 feet away from you                   Success         You push your target back 5 feet                                        Stride                                                         Move               Move a distance up to your Speed. If you move across extremely difficult or hazardous terrain, the GM might ask you make a die roll to determine if your Stride power was successful.                       Strike                                                         Attack                                Target         One creature within your reach (for a melee attack) or within your weapon’s range (for a ranged attack)                  Make an attack roll against the target’s Defense. The attack roll is a Strength roll for melee weapons or an Agility roll for ranged weapons. Weapons with the Finesse trait let you choose either Strength or Agility for the attack roll.   When you make a ranged Strike, you can optionally choose to make a long-range Strike to try to hit a distant target. If you do, you have disadvantage on the attack roll, but your Strike has double the range.                       Critical Success         You deal damage equal to 2 * the weapon’s base damage + the attack roll’s attribute                   Success         You deal damage equal to the weapon’s base damage + the attack roll’s attribute                                        Sustain                                                         Concentrate                                Requirements         You have at least one spell active with a sustained duration                  Choose one spell with a sustained duration you have in effect. The duration of that spell continues until the end of your next turn. Some spells might have slightly different or expanded effects if you sustain them. If your Sustain power is disrupted, the spell immediately ends.   If the spell you sustain has the Attack trait, you must repeat the attack roll. Apply the result of this attack roll as if you had cast the spell again. If you get a Failure on this roll, you cannot sustain this spell again. The spell still continues until the end of your next turn.

        "title": "Basic Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are some common rules for the game.   Die Rolls   When you attempt a task that has a chance of failing, you roll dice to determine if your attempt succeeds or fails. All die rolls are associated one stat, called the bonus of the die roll. This stat is usually an attribute or a skill, but can be any number. The die roll is usually referred to by this bonus: if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Strength attribute, then it’s called a Strength roll, or if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Stealth skill, then it’s called a Stealth roll.   To make the die roll, roll 1d20 and add the bonus, and note the result. Your result measures how effectively you attempt the task. Compare this value to the DC set by the GM, using the table below. If you roll a 20 on the die, then your result is one level of success higher than it would normally be. If you roll a 1 on the die, then your result is one level of success lower than it would normally be.   Levels of Success          Result     Values     Description           Critical Success     DC + 10 or more     An exceptionally good result, with bonus positive effects           Success     DC + 0 ... DC + 9     You succeed at the task you were attempting           Failure     DC - 10 ... DC - 1     You fail at the task you were attempting           Critical Failure     DC - 11 or less     An exceptionally bad result, with possible negative effects      Difficulty Classes   The DC (Difficulty Class) of a die roll is usually determined by the GM based on how hard the task seems. The GM is encouraged to used the table below to help them decide the DC. Some abilities call for a die roll against a specific DC. For example, the Strike power calls for a die roll where the DC is your target’s Defense stat.   Sample Difficulties          Difficulty     DC     Description           Simple     10     Something a normal person could do with some effort           Average     15     A task a skilled professional could struggle with           Hard     20     Requires significant training to accomplish           Very Hard     25     Very difficult even for a skilled professional           Extremely Hard     30     Almost impossible except for the greatest masters alive           Impossible     40     At the edge of human achievement, never been done before      Advantage, Disadvantage, and Rerolls   Some effects can give you advantage or disadvantage on a die roll, representing a minor cicumstantial bonus or penalty. When you have advantage on a die roll, you roll the d20 twice and take the higher value. When you have disadvantage on a die roll, you roll the d20 twice and take the lower value. If you have both advantage and disadvantage on a die roll, you only roll the d20 once.   Some effects let you reroll a die roll after it’s made. When you do, repeat the exact same die roll, with the same bonuses, penalties, advantage, and disadvantage as the original. Then, you can pick whether to use the original die roll or the new one.   Turns in Combat   Characters take turns during combat, as who acts first can be very important. When a fight breaks out, everyone involved makes an Initiative roll. Whoever gets the highest result takes the first turn. On your turn, you can use one  power and any number of  powers. You can’t use the same  power more than once on the same turn.   At the end of your turn, you pick who takes the next turn, ally or enemy. If you attacked a creature, that creature can choose to Interrupt your choice and take the next turn instead. No matter what, no one can take multiple turns in the same round. The round ends once everyone has taken a turn. The person who took the last turn in the round chooses who starts the next round. If you took the last turn in a round, you can choose yourself to go first the next round.   Attacks   Some powers represent offensive effects designed to hurt or impede enemies. These are called Attack powers, or just attacks for short. Attacks always involve a die roll, called the attack roll. The attacker makes the the attack roll only once, no matter how many targets the attack has. The attack roll specifies which of the target’s stat to use as the DC, usually Defense or an attribute DC. Since each target can have a different value for this DC, an attack can hit one target but miss another.   For example, the Strike power is an attack. Imagine that Alice uses the Strike power, slashing at Bob with a sword. Alice makes a Strength attack roll against Bob’s Defense. If the result of Alice’s attack roll is equal to or higher than Bob’s Defense score, then Alice’s attack is a success, and deals damage as described in the Strike power.",

      {
        "title": "Character Creation",
        "excerpt": "As in other tabletop RPGs, before beginning character creation, you should talk with your group about the general setting and style of your game. Ask your GM what character level you’re starting at, and if they’re using any custom rules. Finally, grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make.   Step 1 - General Theme   The first step in making any character is deciding what you generally want your character to be. Will you be a powerful mage, casting arcane spells that reshape reality? A kung-fu master who can somersault and jump between enemies? A hardened soldier with a variety of weapons, who can tough through any situation?   In this step, you should develop these ideas more, working out the details of what you imagine your character will act and feel like. While you don’t have to write any of this down, you should keep it in mind as you create the rest of your character. The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.   Step 2 - Attributes   The next step is to determine your character’s attributes. Characters in Forge of Power have 4 attributes: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Spirit. Your score in each attribute is a single number, which can range from -2 to +10. The average value of an attribute for a normal human is +0. See the Attributes page for a description of each attribute.   Your starting score in each attribute is a number between -1 and +3. You can choose any starting scores you want such that your scores sum to a total to 4. For example, you could start with +3 Strength, -1 Agility, +2 Intellect, and +0 Spirit, since 3 - 1 + 2 + 0 = 4. Write your score in each attribute on your character sheet.   Improving Attributes   If you’re making a level 2 or higher character, your attributes are even higher. For every even level (level 2, 4, 6, etc.), choose to either:     Increase your highest attribute by 1   Increase two attributes lower than your highest attribute by 1 each   Step 3 - Ancestry   Choose one ancestry from the Ancestries page.   Step 4 - Class Levels   Your character’s main ability come from your class, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 20 classes in Forge of Power. See the Classes page for a full list of all classes and their descriptions.   When you create your character, you split your character level between the classes. Write your level in each class on your character sheet. Your character level and your level in a class determine your tier in the class, as shown in the table below:           Tier     Character Level     Class Level           Novice     1     1           Veteran     5     3           Master     11     5           Epic     17     7      Talents   Your character knows a number of talents from each class equal to your level in that class. All talents have a tier, which is shown next to the talent’s name. To learn a talent, you must be at least that tier in the talent’s c;ass.   For example, imagine you are creating a level 5 character. You could choose to put 3 levels in Blaster and 2 levels in Duelist. This makes you a Veteran Blaster and a Novice Duelist. You then learn 3 talents from the Blaster class, all of which must be either Novice or Veteran. You also learn 2 talents from the Duelist class, both of which must be Novice.   As another example, imagine you are creating a level 11 character. You could choose to put all 11 levels in the Arcanist class. This makes you a Master Arcanist. You then learn 11 talents from the Arcanist class, all of which must be Novice, Veteran, or Master.   Ribbons   In addition to talents, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are associated to classes, and are very similar to talents, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities.   You learn one ribbon at every odd character level (1, 3, 5, etc.). This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You can’t pick ribbons from a classes that you have no levels in, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.   Step 5 - Feats   Feats are abilities that represent your character becoming stronger generally, in a way that isn’t tied to any specific class. Feats are divided into four categories:     General Feats give you generally useful abilities that don’t fit into the other categories   Ancestry Feats give you special abilities related to your ancestry, and always have a specific ancestry as a prerequisite   Combat Feats make you better at combat, giving you damage bonuses to weapons or spells   Skill Feats make you better at skills, giving you bonuses to die rolls for those skills   All combat feats and skill feats give Perk bonuses. Perk bonuses only stack up to a certain amount depending on your character level. This cap limits the amount you can specialize in one area, so after you reach this cap, it’s better to choose other types of feats.   Starting Feats   Your character starts with two combat feats and four skill feats.   Extra Feats   You learn one additional feat for each character level, which can be from any category.   Step 6 - Other Stats   You’re now almost finished making your character! The only game mechanics task remaining is to write down a few numbers describing various aspects of your character.   Health. Your Health measures how much damage you can take before falling unconscious. Your Health is equal to 20 + Character Level + 4 * Strength.   Defense. Your Defense measures how well you can avoid, dodge, or parry physical attacks. Your Defense is equal to 8 + an attribute determined by your apparel.   Speed. Your Speed determines how far you can move when you Stride. Your character has a Speed of 30 feet.   Stat DC. You have a DC for each of your attributes. This measures how well you can defend against effects targeting that attribute. Your DC for a given attribute is equal to 10 + the attribute.   Magic &amp; Mana. If you can cast spells, you have two special stats, Magic and Mana. Your Magic determines the overall potency of your spells. Your Mana determines how many spells you can cast before running out of magical energy. See the Mystic Origins page for details.   Step 7 - Equipment   Don’t forget to buy equipment to use in your adventures! You start with (10 * your character level) gold pieces (gp). You can buy any equipment listed on the Equipment page.   Step 8 - Proficiencies   You can pick up the 10 proficiencies, which include:     Specific areas of knowledge   Languages   Tools   Musical instruments   Vehicles   Step 9 - Aspects   What your character will choose to do is as important as what your character has the power to do. Every player character has a list of Aspects, which are unique personality traits or flaws that define them. Your Aspects act as a guide to help you roleplay your character, and are useful for Setbacks. See the Narrative Rules page for details.   When you make your character, you should write down at least three Aspects that make you stand out. Feel free to add, modify, or remove Aspects at any time as your understanding of your character’s personality changes. The categories and random generators below can help give you ideas for your character’s Aspects.   Habits. These describe the obvious character actions that makes your character stand out from the average adventurer.     Weird Skills. These describe your character’s unique skills in strangely specific tasks, things you do better than anyone else.     Bonds. These describe the causes your character cares deeply about, the fundamental beliefs that drive you to act. They also describe the personal connections your character has with family, close friends, loved ones, organizations, or even special items.     Flaws. These describe character flaws that may impede your character and provide a source of narrative conflict.     Step 10 - Backstory   The final step in making a character is figuring out how you reached the start of the adventure. You should write down some basic notes about where your character was raised, any previous jobs you’ve held, and how you met the rest of the party. Your backstory is also the perfect place to introduce the NPC contacts that your character knows. The more detail you write, the better your GM will be able to merge this detail with the campaign setting.   Levelling Up   When you level up, you gain:     One talent   One feat   If it’s an odd level, one ribbon   If it’s an even level, one Attribute Score Improvement   In general, whenever you level up, you can change any character build decisions you made earlier, except what classes you have levels in. You can forget talents and learn new talents in their place, change your feats, and so on. Check with your GM before making especially drastic changes when you level up.",

        "title": "Character Creation",
        "excerpt": "As in other tabletop RPGs, before beginning character creation, you should talk with your group about the general setting and style of your game. Ask your GM what character level you’re starting at, and if they’re using any custom rules. Finally, grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make.   Where to Start   The first step in making any character is deciding what you generally want your character to be. Will you be a powerful mage, casting arcane spells that reshape reality? A kung-fu master who can somersault and jump between enemies? A hardened soldier with a variety of weapons, who can tough through any situation?   Before you start the rest of character creation, try to imagine the details of what your character will act and feel like. While you don’t have to write any of this down, you should keep it in mind as you create the rest of your character. The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.   Once you have a character in mind, you should go through the other steps on this page in order. Briefly, these steps are:     Ancestry: Choose your character’s race or culture   Background: Choose what your character did before adventuring   Classes: Choose your character’s special abilities   Development: Choose extra abilities that your character gets as they level up   Equipment: Choose your character’s starting equipment   Final stats: Write down the final numerical details on your character sheet   Narrative: Describe your character’s personality and backstory   At the end of each of the sections below, text in italics gives the exact mechanical steps you need to follow to create your character. If you’re in a hurry and you’re already familiar with this system, you can skip everything that’s not in italics.   Building Bruenor   In each of the sections below, I give an example of how to build a character. I use the same example character as D&amp;D 5e: the player Bob is creating his character Bruenor Battlehammer, a dwarven warrior-king who longs to rebuild his lost ancestral fortress of Mithril Hall. Bob imagines Bruenor as a tough frontline warrior who protects his friends, so he stays on the lookout for abilities that will boost Bruenor’s defense and melee combat skills.   Ancestry   Your character’s ancestry describes the abilities you gain from your ancestors. This includes biological abilities unique to your character’s species, such as a Lizardfolk’s mutations or an Undead’s physiology. It also includes cultural abilities you learned from the people who raised you, such as a Dwarf’s family connections or a Orc’s hardiness.   People of different ancestries are adept in different areas. For example, the average Orc is physically larger and stronger than the average Goblin. Your ancestry gives initial values for your four main attributes: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Spirit. Your ancestry also gives values for your Speed and Size.   Many ancestries give you additional bonuses or choices. In particular, many ancestries ask you to choose an ancestry feat, which is a special type of power that represents an ability you gained from your ancestry.   Choose one ancestry from the Ancestries page, and write your choice on your character sheet. Write the stat values given by your ancestry on your character sheet. Note each of the additional bonuses given by your ancestry in the corresponding part of your character sheet.   Building Bruenor   Bruenor is a tough mountain dwarf. Bob says that Bruenor has the dwarf ancestry. This means that Bruenor starts with a +0 Strength, Agility, and Intellect, and +1 Spirit. Bruenor also starts with a Speed of 25 feet and a size of 0. Bob writes all of these stats on Bruenor’s character sheet.   The dwarf ancestry gives Bruenor two tool proficiencies and an ancestry feat. Bob chooses for Bruenor to be proficient in miner’s tools and blacksmith’s tools, and Bob chooses the Dwarven Resilience ancestry feat. Bob writes the two tool proficiences on the Proficiencies section of Bruenor’s character sheet, and he notes the feat on the Powers page of Bruenor’s sheet. Reading the Dwarven Resilience feat, Bob notes 5 Poison Shield and 5 Bludgeoning Shield on the Shields and Weaknesses section of Bruenor’s character sheet so that he’ll remember them later.   Backgrounds      Variant Rule         If you're in a hurry, choosing backgrounds can take up a lot of time. Instead of choosing two backgrounds as below, you can use the following simplified rules to pick skills, weapons, and proficiencies.      Pick any four skills and any two weapons. You gain the Skill Expertise power for each skill, and the Weapon Expertise power for each weapon.                 Skill Expertise                                   Perk         +2 to the chosen skill                  You have advantage on all die rolls with the chosen skill.                       Weapon Expertise                                   Perk         +1 damage to Strikes with the chosen weapon                  You have a +1 bonus on all attack rolls with the chosen weapon.             Your character’s backgrounds describe what your character did before they became an adventurer. This affects your character’s skills, proficiencies, and starting feats. You have two backgrounds, representing skills learned at different parts of your life. For example, your first background might represent your life as a child, and your second background might represent your life as an adult.   Your backgrounds always give you several skill feats and combat feats. These are special types of powers that represent your character’s training in various skills and weapons. These feats always come with an extra bonus, called a Perk bonus, that makes you better at rolls involving the skill or weapon. Depending on your character level, you can’t stack too many Perk bonuses on the same stat, as shown in the table below:           Character Level     Max Stacking           6 or less     1           7 ... 12     2           13 ... 18     3           19 or more     4      Your backgrounds also give you a number of proficiencies, which represent specialized knowledge in a particular tool, language, or field of study. Proficiencies differ from skills in that they’re much more specialized, and won’t come up as often in an adventure.   Choose two backgrounds from the Backgrounds page, and write your choices on your character sheet. Choose the skill and combat feats given by your backgrounds. Write all the feats you chose on your character sheet. Write all the perk bonuses you gained on your character sheet. Choose the proficiencies given by your backgrounds, and write them on your character sheet.   Building Bruenor   TODO   Classes   Your character’s main ability come from your class, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 20 classes in Forge of Power. See the Classes page for a full list of all classes and their descriptions. Your character is initially level 0 in each class. For each of your character levels, you gain a level in one class of your choice. This means that your character level is equal to the sum of all your class levels. Your character level and your level in a class determine your tier in the class, as shown in the table below:           Tier     Character Level     Class Level           Novice     1     1           Veteran     7     3           Master     13     5           Epic     19     7      The table above lists the requirements your character must meet in order to reach a tier in a class. For example, to be a Veteran Berserker, you must both have a character level of at least 7 and a Berserker level of at least 3.   Talents are the main abilities your character can use. They define your character’s combat abilities. Each class has a list of talents. Your character knows a number of talents from each class equal to your level in that class. All talents have a tier, which is shown next to the talent’s name. To learn a talent, you must be at least that tier in the talent’s class.   In addition to talents, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are very similar to talents, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities. You learn one ribbon at every odd character level (1, 3, 5, etc.). This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You can’t pick ribbons from a classes that you have no levels in, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.   Split your character level between the classes. Write your level in each class on your character sheet. Pick a number of talents from each class equal to your level in that class. Make sure you meet the tier requirements for each talent you pick. Write each talent you chose on your character sheet. Pick a number of ribbons equal to half your character level (rounded up), which can be from any class you have levels in. Write each ribbon you chose on your character sheet.   Building Bruenor   TODO   Development   TODO   Choose a number of feats equal to your character level, and write them on your character sheet. Choose a number of attribute boosts equal to half your character level (rounded down), and modify your attributes accordingly.   Building Bruenor   TODO   Equipment   TODO   Spend up to 10 * (your character level) gold on items. Write each item you bought on your character sheet. Write any remaining gold on your character sheet.   Building Bruenor   TODO   Final Stats   TODO   For each attribute, write the attribute DC (equal to your attribute score + 10) on your character sheet. Write your maximum health (equal to 10 + 2 * level + 5 * Strength) on your character sheet. Write your Defense score (given by your armor) on your character sheet.   If your character knows any spells, also do the following steps. Choose one mystic origin from the Mystic Origins page, and write it on your character sheet. Write your maximum mana (given by your mystic origin) on your character sheet.   Building Bruenor   TODO   Narrative   TODO   Choose between three and ten aspects, and write them on your character sheet. Tell the GM your character’s backstory.   Building Bruenor   TODO",

        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to combat. See the All Powers page for a list of common actions you can take in combat.   Power Properties   Some powers have a range in feet. If the power doesn’t list a target or an area, it targets one creature you can see within range.   Some powers have an area. If the power lists a range, the area is centered on a point you can see within range, otherwise the area is centered on you. If the power doesn’t list a target, it targets all creatures in the area.   Some powers have a duration. When the duration ends, the power’s effect completely ends. The world returns to its normal state, as if the power hadn’t been used. Any permanent changes the power made to the world, such as inflicting or healing damage, don’t disappear when the power ends. You can’t end an ongoing power early unless it specifies that in its duration.   Surprise   If you start combat with a creature that isn’t prepared for an imminent attack, that creature is surprised for the first round of combat. Creatures that are surprised, that can’t see you, or that otherwise aren’t expecting you to attack are flat-footed against you.   Falling   If there is nothing supporting your character, you fall. You fall up to 500 feet each round. When you fall 10 or more feet, you take 1d6 damage for each 10 feet, up to a cap of 50d6 damage at 500 feet. The number of dice is reduced by half if you fall onto a soft surface, such as a pile of hay or a pool of water. You land prone if you take any damage from a fall.   Cover   Some environmental features, such as battlements or arrow slits, make it much harder for creatures to hit you with attacks. At the GM’s discretion, these environmental features may give you cover from enemies. In general, you have cover from an enemy if at least 3/4 of your body is blocked by a solid object. If you have cover from an enemy, you have a +5 bonus to Defense against their attacks.   Health   All characters have a Health pool that represents how healthy they currently are. Your Health pool stores a number of points, up to a maximum of your Health stat. When you take damage, you must subtract the damage taken from your Health pool. When you heal, you add the points healed to your Health pool. Your Health pool can never go below 0. While your Health pool is 0, you have the downed condition.   Some effects can give you a pool of temporary HP. When you take damage, subtract the damage from your temporary HP first, then subtract any remaining damage from your Health pool. Multiple sources of temporary HP do not stack, you only keep the highest.   Dying   TODO: Write this section",

You can choose your relative’s general personality, temperament, and profession, subject to the GM’s approval. Your relative is friendly towards you and will help you with simple favors, but will not risk their life to help you.   For example, if you are in a normal town, you can declare that your second cousin works as a blacksmith, and then go visit him to repair your sword. Or if you’re in the BBEG’s giant volcano lair, you can declare that your father’s brother-in-law’s niece works in the lair as one of the BBEG’s henchmen.

For example, you could choose to share memories of a certain event, current experiences of emotions, or thoughts on philosophy. The GM determines which exact experiences of this type are shared.   Make an Intellect attack roll against your target’s Intellect DC. (As with all rolls, you can choose to automatically fail or critically fail this roll.)

The base damage of this strike is 1d4. This strike deals an extra 20 damage against inanimate objects.   You can efficiently tunnel through walls by repeatedly using this power. As a rough estimate, in one minute of work, you can tunnel through 1 foot of soft material (dirt, sand, plaster) or a few inches of hard material (wood, loose stones, old masonry). You can’t tunnel through materials you can’t damage, such as solid stone or metal.

The GM assigns a DC for this claim based on how extreme it is: a reasonble claim would be DC 5-10, a very unusual one might be DC 15, while a crazy or impossible claim would be DC 20 or more. The GM and the player should agree on the DC. Then, the GM rolls a d20 in secret. If this d20 meets or exceeds the DC, then the claim is actually true, otherwise, the claim is actually false.

You must have reasonably been able to craft this item in the past 24 hours.   For example, if you’re delving a dungeon, you could pull out a crowbar and reveal you forged one earlier at the local smithy. Alternatively, if you’re preparing a meal for a lord, you could reveal that you had already made the lord’ favorite food. The GM has final say on whether any item is reasonable.         And here’s one I prepared earlier…                                  Mouse Trap                         Crafting                                  Perk         +2 Crafting                  Whenever you set a mechanical trap or build a large device, you can disguise the mechanism as a set of completely mundane objects, which you placed to perfectly trigger a cascading effect. Anyone casually searching the area never realizes the mundane objects have any mechanical effect. Someone who is determinedly searching the area for traps or devices has a -10 penalty to any rolls made to detect the mechanism.

For example, you might notice that one section of a bookcase is suspiciously clear of dust, that an NPC’s bearing suggests they are feeling especially anxious, or a unusual footprint on a section of floor.         Use common sense to determine what counts as a room. We all speak English here.

You spread the phrase through the crowd of people, who take up the chant. The duration of this power depends on the chant - an insane or disagreeable chant will die down in seconds, while a popular and agreeable chant might last a long time. This power does not force anyone to agree with the content of the cheer - people are just caught in a wave of mob energy.

If past events in the campaign contradict this rule, then the rule isn’t very important to the average practicioner of your religion.   From now on, all believers in your character’s religion publicly follow the declared rule. Breaking the rule is considered a terrible taboo.

Whenever you hide behind or inside of an inanimate, immobile object, you can slightly adjust this object to perfectly blend into its surroundings. Even if the object would normally be wildly out of place, no one notices the object is strange in any way. This effect ends if the object moves, if the object is a threat or obstacle, or if you are no longer hidden behind or inside of the object.   For example, you can hide inside of a box in the middle of the floor, and no one will question why the box is there so long as it stays still. You can hide behind a tall potted plant next to a lava lake in the middle of an evil dungeon, and no one will question the plant’s existence.

        "excerpt": "Hello, and welcome to the core rulebook of Forge of Power! I assume that if you’re reading this, you’re already familiar with tabletop RPGs, like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, or Shadowrun. After years of playing these games, I found rules that I wanted to change, new mechanics I wanted to introduce, and interesting ideas I wanted to combine. The result was this system, Forge of Power, that takes all my favorite mechanics from across many systems and merges them together. I think the whole has become more than the sum of its parts.   Versatile Character Creation   Forge of Power tries to maximize the number of options available in character creation. Unlike D&amp;D or Pathfinder, characters in Forge of Power do not choose a single class that determines what your character does. Instead, whenever a character levels up, they can choose a talent, a special ability that makes the character much stronger in one way. Talents are organized by theme into collections of related talents, called classes. Characters are free to mix and match talents from different classes, letting you pick the perfect combination of talents to realize your character’s theme.   To expand your options even further, classes have minor abilities called ribbons, which make characters more flavorful or thematic, without greatly affecting your combat power. Ribbons separate out combat strength from roleplaying abilities, making it so every character always has unique strengths to offer both in combat and in social interactions.   Tactical Combat   Like many other roleplaying games, Forge of Power puts a heavy emphasis on combat. The game rules try to make combat as interesting as possible for all characters. All characters, magical and martial, have access to the same number of powers. This means that the fighter will have just as many interesting options to use in combat as the wizard. A lot of effort has been spent trying to balance the various powers against each other. No strategy in combat should ever clearly be much stronger than another.   Setting   Forge of Power was designed around a medieval fantasy world, just like D&amp;D or Pathfinder. Players can expect a setting where brave paladins fight against cunning devils, elven wizards duel against ancient dragons, and adventurers regularly delve into dungeons to slay monsters and recover hidden treasures. That said, the game rules never assume the game uses a specific setting, and groups can play this system in a universe of their choice. Forge of Power can be adapted to completely different settings with only minor modifications. Running a futuristic sci-fi game only requires changing the equipment list to add plasma guns, lightsabers, and spaceships. Running a realistic medieval game is as simple as banning all the “magical” classes.",

        "title": "Narrative Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are rules that help groups play out interesting stories.  ## Aspects  TODO: Write this section  ## Quests  The game is divided into **quests**, each of which has a single well-defined objective. Each quest has a current **Challenge** score, which usually starts at 1. When the party completes a quest, everyone gains XP equal to the quest’s Challenge score. A player character levels up whenever they reach a multiple of 10 XP.  Whenever the GM adds a complication to the quest, they should increase the Challenge by 1. Especially deadly complications might increase the Challenge by 2 or more.  The party can vote to spend 1 Challenge point to introduce a reasonable plot point that makes the quest easier, such as calling in allies to help, or adding a lucky coincidence that works in their favor. The GM determines whether a proposed plot point would be reasonable. Introducing a plot point can only trivialize the quest if it reduces the Challenge to 0.  ## Inspiration  Every player has a pool of **inspiration** points that they can spend to influence the story. You can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any die roll that any character makes. When you do, you must explain how your character somehow influences the roll. Even just yelling a few words of moral support counts.  You start every session with 1 inspiration point. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration. You can also earn inspiration through Setbacks (see below). Unspent inspiration goes away at the end of a session.  ## Setbacks  In books, movies, and shows, we constantly see characters act against their best interests. This makes for interesting, realistic stories of complex, flawed characters. These self-imposed setbacks often act to reinforce the theme of a story. A comedy show relies on exagerrated, silly characters who make humorous mistakes. A grim drama relies on characters with emotional scars that flare up at the worst times.  Forge of Power encourages these stories by compensating players for in-character setbacks. At any time, a player can propose a **Setback**, explaining how a character might act in a way that makes the current quest harder for the entire party. The proposed action has to match the game's theme: if you're running a comedic game, the Setback must be humorous, or if you're running a grimdark game, the Setback must be dark or hurtful. The proposed action must also directly relate to one of the character's Aspects.  The player who controls the character (or the GM, if the character is an NPC) can then choose to accept or reject the proposed Setback. If they accept the Setback, then the proposed action occurs in the game. Both the player who proposed the Setback and the player controlling the character gain 1 inspiration (if you Setback your own character, you gain 2 inspiration). The current quest's Challenge score increases by 1.  Setbacks have a few limitations. First, many Setbacks require an in-character action that can be blocked by other characters. For example, if the reckless character tries to charge into a fight, their party might grab them before they run off. If the action is blocked by other characters, the Setback is cancelled. Second, the same character can't be the cause of a Setback twice in a row. (The same player *can* propose two Setbacks in a row, if they want.) Third, you can't Setback the same Aspect twice in the same game session.",

        "title": "Spell Rules",
        "excerpt": "Following are more advanced rules related to spells.  ## Casting Spells  A power with the [[Spell]] trait is called a **spell**. Using such a power is called **casting** the spell. Casting a spell requires speaking a command phrase and making hand gestures, which usually make it obvious that you are casting a spell. All spells implicitly have the [[Concentrate]] and [[Manipulate]] traits.  Casting spells requires an **arcane focus**, which is a handheld item you use to channel your magic. You can meditate or focus for 1 hour to designate an item as your arcane focus. Bonding to a new arcane focus severs your connection with your previous focus. You can pick any item as your arcane focus - a staff, a book, a crystal gem, a sword, or so on. You must hold your arcane focus in one hand while casting a spell or using the {Sustain} power.  ## Mana  All characters that can cast spells have a Mana pool that represents how much magical energy they have available. Your Mana pool stores a number of points, up to a maximum of your Mana stat. When you pay Mana to cast a spell, you must subtract the amount paid from your Mana pool. Your Mana pool can never go below 0. Your [mystic origin](mystic-origins.html) determines your Mana stat and describes when your Mana pool replenishes.  All spells have a **cost** in Mana. You must pay this amount of Mana when you cast the spell. If you don't have enough Mana, you can't cast the spell. Some effects reduce the cost of a spell. You must always spend at least 1 Mana when you cast a spell, or at least 0 Mana if the spell has the [[Cantrip]] trait.  ## Heightening Spells  You can **heighten** some spells to increase their effect, at the cost of paying more Mana to use the spell. When you cast a spell, you can choose to pay more Mana than the listed cost, up to a limit of half your character's total Mana.  If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (per +X Mana)**, then for each X Mana you pay above the base cost, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (total X Mana)**, then if you pay a total of at least X mana, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's descriptions has multiple **Heightened** enties, then all of them apply.  ## Customizing Spells  Spells are flexible effects, and the caster has significant leeway in choosing how the spell is expressed. A powerful spellcaster who conjures vast firestorms could use that same spell to light a single candle. You can reduce the area, range, duration, or damage of a spell as much as you want when you cast the spell, though the cost stays the same. Ask your GM what other parameters you can change for a given spell. Once you cast the spell, you no longer have direct control over the magic, so you have to pick any changes when you cast the spell.  Players are encouraged to describe their spells differently than how they're described in the rules. For example, instead of describing your {Fireball} spell as an explosion of flames, you could describe it as a flash of lightning, an intense wave of radiation, or as briefly transporting targets to a Hell dimension. Your unique description for your spell is called the spell's Trappings.  Trappings shouldn't change how a spell functions in normal circumstances. The GM might say that Trappings change how a spell acts in unusual circumstances, such as a flash of lightning being more effective than a fireball when the target is underwater. Creatively using spells is cool, and should be encouraged.",

        "excerpt": "Berserkers are aggressive melee fighters who believe that the best defense is a good offense. They charge into enemy lines, lay waste to their opponents, and refuse to give up and die. Berserkers are notoriously angry, and are adept at channeling their rage into combat power.   Berserker talents give amazing boosts to melee damage. Some of their talents help them resist damage, but others lower their own defense in exchange for damage.

        "excerpt": "Duelists are expert melee fighters who rely on their amazing skill with weapons. They excel in the art of the duel, specializing in one-on-one combat. Many duelists come from noble or gladiatorial backgrounds, where skill and elegance in combat are highly valued. Duelists most often wield swords.   Duelist talents focus on accurate attacks and impenetrable defenses. Many of their talents give them the chance to add another attack in a moment of opportunity or weakness in their opponent’s defenses.

        "excerpt": "Guardians are defensive fighters who use shields and heavy armor to protect themselves and their allies. They fight in the front lines as vanguards who distract attention from their more vulnerable allies. Many guardians are altruistic and supportive fighters who focus on defending others before themselves.   Guardian talents greatly increase defense against all attacks and spells. Many guardian talents distract enemies from your allies and force them to attack only you instead.

        "excerpt": "Swordsages are mystical fighters who perform supernatural feats of martial ability. They often fight in melee, but many swordsages try to avoid the front lines. Swordsages’ supernatural abilities come from their innate ki powers, which they might have unlocked through years of meditation and training.   Swordsage talents produce a variety of supernatural effects without relying on formal arcane magic. Their talents might create mirages of multiple attacks, turn the swordsage incorporeal as they dodge, or shape their ki into solid objects. Swordsage ribbons use ki for minor utility effects.   Examples of swordsages in fiction include almost all anime fighters that have supernatural abilities, as well as some high fantasy magic swordsmen and wuxia heroes.

        "excerpt": "Warblades are specialist fighters who develop a unique personal fighting style. Every warblade is completely different from every other warblade, as they all develop distinct and specialized weapons and fighting styles. Warblades usually trained at small esoteric martial arts schools with few practitioners.   Warblade talents use weapons for unique or customizable martial maneuvers. Warblades can specialize in any combination of offense, defense, and utility, depending on what maneuvers they choose.

Only you can wield your exotic weapon. If you ever lose your exotic weapon, you can obtain a replacement when you complete an 8-hour rest.

        "title": "Acrobat",
        "excerpt": "Acrobats are agile combatants who leap and dodge between attacks. They move through the front line with ease, dodging enemy attacks and retaliating with speed and precision. Acrobats are known for their supernatural abilities to move on difficult terrain, running up walls, along water, or even walking on thin air.   Acrobat talents focus on movement and dodging attacks. The majority of acrobat talents are defensive, though a few give opportunities to disorient enemies or counterattack.

        "excerpt": "Hunters are ranged warriors who focus on taking down targets with precise, deadly shots. They are unmatched when it comes to chasing and defeating single targets, as enemies can’t flee from their range and accuracy. Most hunters avoid fighting in melee, preferring to use their range to their advantage.   Hunter talents give a variety of boosts to ranged weapons and single-target attacks. Some talents give buffs to single long-range shots with high accuracy and damage, while others give buffs to attacks against specific targets.

The turret is a Minion creature with (10 * your Inventor level) Health, 15 Defense, and 0 Speed. The turret’s Strength and Agility are equal to your Intellect, and it has no Intellect or Spirit stats. The turret can fire its cannon as a ranged weapon that deals 2d8 Piercing damage and has a range of 150 feet.

Your servant loyally follows orders you give them, even if those orders are insane or suicidal put them in extreme danger. As a robot, your servant is incapable of advanced thought or social interaction, and may interpret orders overly literally. If combat stats are necessary, your servant is a Minion commoner, except it has no Spirit score and is immune to Mental effects.

        "excerpt": "Rogues are sneaky fighters who prefer trickery to fighting fair. They are experts in twisting combats to their advantage, distracting and misdirecting enemies. Most rogues favor stealth and surprise attacks over direct combat. Rogues have a generally negative reputation as thieves, liars, and assassins.   Rogue talents give many ways to confuse or avoid enemies. They also include ways to exploit a distraction for all it’s worth, with powerful sneak attacks and finishing moves. Rogue talents also let them escape danger through luck or stealth. Rogue ribbons give more ways to sneak around and avoid getting caught.   Examples of rogues in fiction include Han Solo from Star Wars, Batman from DC Comics, Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Carribean, and Corvo Attano from Dishonored.

        "excerpt": "Strategists are leaders who support their team in and out of combat. They might be inspirational warriors who lead from the front, but they can also be noncombatants who lend aid without interfering directly. Strategists are known for their supernatural planning abilities, staying three steps ahead of their enemies at all times.   Strategist talents focus on supporting allies instead of acting directly. Many of these talents give tactical combat bonuses, letting their allies have extra actions, damage, or defense. Strategists have almost no talents that affect only themselves. Strategist ribbons give them the social and tactical abilities they need as leaders.

You explain the details of your plan, which retroactively become fact. Your plan must be something that you could have conceivably prepared within the past 24 hours. Your plan cannot involve any actions that would require die rolls to succeed.         For example, if you are investigating a dungeon, you could announce that you remembered to bring 100 feet of rope and a grappling hook, as you had anticipated that you might fall down a chasm. Alternatively, if you are in a meeting with the evil mayor, you could announce that you had arranged for the captain of the guard to be wandering by at just the right time, as you had predicted that the mayor would reveal his plan at this exact time. The GM has final say on whether any plan is reasonable.

        "title": "Arcanist",
        "excerpt": "Arcanists are expert mages who specialize in manipulating magical forces in complex ways. They are the most academic and formal casters, and are the best at complex rituals, wards, and enchantments. Arcanists are often found in wizard academies and guardian fortresses, where their skill at defensive warding is put to use.   Arcanist talents give a variety of utility and combat effects, with a focus on defense. These talents give ways to set up wards and runes, dispel other magic effects, and build constructs of magical force. Arcanists have no purely offensive talents. Arcanist ribbons further enhance their knowledge about and ability to manipulate magic.   Examples of arcanists in fiction include the entire cast of Harry Potter, any D&amp;D caster that specializes in abjuration, as well as most fictional academically-trained wizards or mages.

If your result is higher than the cost of the triggering spell, the triggering spell doesn’t take effect.

The glyph does nothing until it triggers. When the glyph triggers, the Explosive Runes effect activates.   You choose the conditions that trigger the glyph. For example, you could choose for the glyph to trigger when any creature touches or stands on the surface, when an object covering the glyph is removed, or when a creature reads the glyph. You can also specify more complex conditions, such as only triggering when a creature fails to speak a particular password. If the glyph is damaged, it triggers immediately. If two glyphs are in the same 5-foot space for 1 hour, their magic interferes and both trigger. If the glyph is moved more than 5 feet, it becomes unable to trigger for 1 minute.   Optionally, you can store a different effect in the glyph instead of Explosive Runes. When you cast this spell, also cast another spell of your choice. This other spell doesn’t take effect as normal, but is instead stored inside the glyph. This other spell takes effect when the glyph triggers. You must specify all the parameters of the spell (including its target, any heightening, and so on) when you store it in the glyph.      Heightened (per +1 Mana)   The damage of the Explosive Runes effect increases by 1d6         I prepared Explosive Runes this morning.

You can choose each panel’s position and orientation, so long as all panels are connected and within range. You cannot conjure a panel in a space occupied by a creature or a solid object.   The wall is physically solid and is weightless. Each panel has 100 Health and 100 Anything Shield. You choose whether the wall is free-floating or whether it rests on a solid surface.

        "excerpt": "Blasters are combat mages who excel in causing massive magical destruction. They blast creatures and structures to pieces with long-range advanced combat magic and elemental explosions. Blasters are often employed as soldiers or warmages, as their explosive area spells can devastate entire formations of mundane soldiers.   Blaster talents focus entirely on causing damage. Most of these talents are different kinds of magical blast attacks, and the rest buff other magical attacks. Blaster talents include almost no defensive or utility abilities, which can make blasters into glass cannons. Blaster ribbons give them minor utility abilities to support their offense.   Examples of blasters in fiction include the black mages from Final Fantasy, any D&amp;D caster that specializes in evocation, and most combat-oriented mages and sorcerers from RPGs.

        "title": "Illusionist",
        "excerpt": "Illusionists are tricky mages who deceive enemies with clever illusions. Illusionists never fight directly, but instead manipulate other creatures’ senses to make them see things that aren’t there or overlook things that are. Many illusionists work as performers, artists, or technical crew, as their magic opens up new possibilities in the performing arts.   Illusionist talents include a variety of ways to distract or disable enemies. Many illusionist talents force enemies to waste time attacking things that aren’t really there. Others manipulate creatures’ minds directly, causing confusing or inciting strong emotions. Illusionist ribbons are mostly small-scale illusions useful out of combat.   Examples of illusionists in fiction include Loki from Marvel Comics, Genjutsu-users from Naruto, and almost every magic-user in real-world mythology.

For example, you could change your eye color, your hairstyle, or the pattern on a tattoo. This change isn’t large enough to disguise your identity.

        "excerpt": "Necromancers are dark casters who manipulate death, undeath, and fear. They raise undead minions to do their bidding and cast powerful death spells to slay their enemies. Necromancers are widely feared by the general population for their dark magic, as their spells have a terrible potential to do harm if misused.   Necromancer talents focus on offensive and utility effects. Some talents channel necrotic energy to harm the living, while others weaken the barrier between life and death and interact with the spirits of the dead. Necromancer ribbons give mostly utility effects related to the necromancer’s unique closeness with death.   Examples of necromancers in fiction include Nagash from Warhammer Fantasy, the White Walkers from A Song of Ice and Fire, and almost all fictional undead characters.

The spirit may choose to answer or stay silent, and it may choose to tell the truth or lie.   After you ask the spirit three questions, it passes on fully, and Speak with Dead cannot target this person again.",

        "excerpt": "Sorcerers are powerful casters who directly manipulate the structure of reality. They bend space and time, move objects with their mind, and conjure objects out of nowhere. Sorcerers are especially known for their command of teleportation magic, as the most powerful sorcerers can cross entire continents in an instant.   Sorcerer talents include a variety of effects related to manipulating reality. Some of these talents act as direct attacks or defenses through telekinesis.

If this material is entirely hard earth or stone, then your sense is as accurate as vision or touch. Otherwise, your sense is less accurate, and you have disadvantage on rolls that depend on perceiving a target. Your sense doesn’t work at all through soft materials, such as sand or water.",

        "excerpt": "Awakened are normal animals that were granted incredible intelligence through magic.   Origin   Once upon a time, there was a powerful druid who lived in harmony with nature. This druid respected the inherent dignity of animals, but they felt that animals were looked down on by humanoids because of their lesser intelligence. This druid invented the Awaken spell to raise animals to the intelligence level of humans. However, this spell worked too well: the awakened animals were even more intelligent than humanoids! The confused and fearful humanoids pushed the awakened away, and the awakened retreated to live solitary lives in their home forests. The Awaken spell was passed down through the generations, so that new animals are slowly being awakened even today.   Physical Description   Awakened appear almost completely like their original animal forms. The main physical difference between awakened animals and their natural relatives is that awakened animals have opposable thumbs that let them use tools as well as humanoids. Awakened have very sophistical brains compared to normal humanoids. Some awakened can instantly solve complex math puzzles, build incredible technological gadgets, or even channel innate psionic powers. Any type of animal can be awakened: bears, gorillas, raccoons, velociraptors, and cats are common.   Society   Most awakened live separately from humanoid society. Awakened rarely build settlements, preferring a natural lifestyle in tune with nature. Awakened sometimes live alongside non-awakened animals, which they see as distant relatives that are too stupid to take care of themselves. The awakened are loosely governed by the druidic conclaves that preserve knowledge of the Awaken spell. These druidic conclaves awaken new animals as fast as they can, but the complex Awaken spell can only be cast by the most powerful druids, which greatly limits the rate of growth of the awakened population.
