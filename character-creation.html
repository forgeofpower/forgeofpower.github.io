      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        
        <p>As in other tabletop RPGs, before beginning character creation, you should talk with your group about the general setting and style of your game. Ask your GM what character level you’re starting at, and if they’re using any custom rules. Finally, grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to Start</h2>

<p>The first step in making any character is deciding what you generally want your character to be. Will you be a powerful mage, casting arcane spells that reshape reality? A kung-fu master who can somersault and jump between enemies? A hardened soldier with a variety of weapons, who can tough through any situation?</p>

<p>Before you start the rest of character creation, try to imagine the details of what your character will act and feel like. While you don’t have to write any of this down, you should keep it in mind as you create the rest of your character. The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.</p>

<p>Once you have a character in mind, you should go through the other steps on this page in order. Briefly, these steps are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ancestry: Choose your character’s race or culture</li>
  <li>Background: Choose what your character did before adventuring</li>
  <li>Classes: Choose your character’s special abilities</li>
  <li>Development: Choose extra abilities that your character gets as they level up</li>
  <li>Equipment: Choose your character’s starting equipment</li>
  <li>Final stats: Write down the final numerical details on your character sheet</li>
  <li>Narrative: Describe your character’s personality and backstory</li>
</ul>

<p><em>At the end of each of the sections below, text in italics gives the exact mechanical steps you need to follow to create your character. If you’re in a hurry and you’re already familiar with this system, you can skip everything that’s not in italics.</em></p>

<h3 id="building-bruenor">Building Bruenor</h3>

<p>In each of the sections below, I give an example of how to build a character. I use the same example character as D&amp;D 5e: the player Bob is creating his character Bruenor Battlehammer, a dwarven warrior-king who longs to rebuild his lost ancestral fortress of Mithril Hall. Bob imagines Bruenor as a tough frontline warrior who protects his friends, so he stays on the lookout for abilities that will boost Bruenor’s defense and melee combat skills. Bob’s GM says that Bruenor starts at level 3.</p>

<h2 id="ancestry">Ancestry</h2>

<p>Your character’s ancestry describes the abilities you gain from your ancestors. This includes biological abilities unique to your character’s species, such as a Lizardfolk’s mutations or an Undead’s physiology. It also includes cultural abilities you learned from the people who raised you, such as a Dwarf’s family connections or a Orc’s hardiness.</p>

<p>People of different ancestries are adept in different areas. For example, the average Orc is physically larger and stronger than the average Goblin. Your ancestry gives initial values for your four main attributes: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Spirit. Your ancestry also gives values for your Speed and Size.</p>

<p>Many ancestries give you additional bonuses or choices. In particular, many ancestries ask you to choose an ancestry feat, which is a special type of power that represents an ability you gained from your ancestry.</p>

<p><em>Choose one ancestry from the <a href="/ancestries.html">Ancestries</a> page, and write your choice on your character sheet. Write the stat values given by your ancestry on your character sheet. Note each of the additional bonuses given by your ancestry in the corresponding part of your character sheet.</em></p>

<h3 id="building-bruenor-1">Building Bruenor</h3>

<p>Bruenor is a tough mountain dwarf. Bob says that Bruenor has the <a href="dwarf.html">dwarf</a> ancestry. This means that Bruenor starts with a +0 Strength, Agility, and Intellect, and +1 Spirit. Bruenor also starts with a Speed of 25 feet and a Size of +0. Bob writes all of these stats on Bruenor’s character sheet.</p>

<p>The dwarf ancestry gives Bruenor two tool proficiencies and an ancestry feat. Bob chooses for Bruenor to be proficient in Mason’s Tools and Smith’s Tools, and Bob chooses the <a href="feats-ancestry.html#dwarven-resilience">Dwarven Resilience</a> ancestry feat. Bob writes the two tool proficiences on the <strong>Proficiencies</strong> section of Bruenor’s character sheet, and he notes the feat on the <strong>Powers</strong> page of Bruenor’s sheet. Reading the Dwarven Resilience feat, Bob notes 5 <span class="trait"><a href="traits.html#poison">Poison</a></span> Shield and 5 <span class="trait"><a href="traits.html#bludgeoning">Bludgeoning</a></span> Shield on the <strong>Shields and Weaknesses</strong> section of Bruenor’s character sheet so that he’ll remember them later.</p>

<h2 id="backgrounds">Backgrounds</h2>

<aside>
  <h3>Variant Rule</h3>
  <p>
    If you're in a hurry, choosing backgrounds can take up a lot of time. Instead of choosing two backgrounds as below, you can use the following simplified rules to pick skills, weapons, and proficiencies.

    Pick any four skills and any two weapons. You gain the <b>Skill Expertise</b> power for each skill, and the <b>Weapon Expertise</b> power for each weapon.
  </p>

  

<div class="power">

<h3 id="skill-expertise">
    Skill Expertise
    
    
</h3>




    <dl class="tags">
    
        <dt>Perk</dt>
        <dd>+2 to the chosen skill</dd>
    
    </dl>
    <hr />


<p>You have advantage on all die rolls with the chosen skill.</p>








</div>

  

<div class="power">

<h3 id="weapon-expertise">
    Weapon Expertise
    
    
</h3>




    <dl class="tags">
    
        <dt>Perk</dt>
        <dd>+1 damage to Strikes with the chosen weapon</dd>
    
    </dl>
    <hr />


<p>You have a +1 bonus on all attack rolls with the chosen weapon.</p>








</div>
</aside>

<p>Your character’s backgrounds describe what your character did before they became an adventurer. This affects your character’s skills, proficiencies, and starting feats. You have two backgrounds, representing skills learned at different parts of your life. For example, your first background might represent your life as a child, and your second background might represent your life as an adult.</p>

<p>Your backgrounds give you several attribute boosts. For each attribute boost, add +1 to one attribute. You can’t increase any attribute above the maximum give in the table below.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Character Level</th>
    <th>Max Attribute Score</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3 or less</td>
    <td>+3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4 ... 7</td>
    <td>+4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8 ... 11</td>
    <td>+5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>12 ... 15</td>
    <td>+6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16 ... 19</td>
    <td>+7</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20 or more</td>
    <td>+8</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Your backgrounds always give you several skill feats and combat feats. These are special types of powers that represent your character’s training in various skills and weapons. These feats always come with an extra bonus, called a <strong>Perk</strong> bonus, that makes you better at rolls involving the skill or weapon. Depending on your character level, you can’t stack too many Perk bonuses on the same stat, as shown in the table below:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Character Level</th>
    <th>Max Perk Stacking</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6 or less</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7 ... 12</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>13 ... 18</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>19 or more</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Your backgrounds also give you a number of proficiencies, which represent specialized knowledge in a particular tool, language, or field of study. Proficiencies differ from skills in that they’re much more specialized, and won’t come up as often in an adventure.</p>

<p><em>Choose two backgrounds from the <a href="/backgrounds.html">Backgrounds</a> page, and write your choices on your character sheet. Choose the skill and combat feats given by your backgrounds. Write all the feats you chose on your character sheet. Write all the perk bonuses you gained on your character sheet. Choose the proficiencies given by your backgrounds, and write them on your character sheet.</em></p>

<h3 id="building-bruenor-2">Building Bruenor</h3>

<p>Bruenor grew up as a prince, set to be the future king of Mithril Hall. After his home was destroyed, Bruenor led his clansmen as a warrior. Bob says that Bruenor has the Noble and Warrior backgrounds.</p>

<p>Bob first picks the abilities given by the Noble background. It gives Bruenor +1 Spirit, the <a href="feats-skill.html#forced-error">Forced Error</a> skill feat, and the <em>Geneology Lore</em> proficiency. It also gives Bruenor +1 Strength, the <a href="feats-skill.html#burst-of-power">Burst of Power</a> skill feat, the <a href="feats-combat.html#shield-bash">Shield Bash</a> combat feat, the <em>Mining Lore</em> proficiency, and the <em>Cave Lore</em> proficiency.</p>

<p>Bob then picks the abilities given by the Warrior background. It gives Bruenor +1 Strength, the <a href="feats-skill.html#scare-to-death">Scare to Death</a> skill feat, and the <em>Warfare Lore</em> proficiency. It also gives Bruenor +1 Strength, the <a href="feats-skill.html#alert">Alert</a> skill feat, the <a href="feats-combat.html#distracting-blow">Distracting Blow</a> combat feat, the <em>Mountain Lore</em> proficiency, and the <em>Tundra Lore</em> proficiency.</p>

<p>Bob applies the attribute boosts to Bruenor’s attributes, ending up with +3 Strength, +0 Agility, +0 Intellect, and +2 Spirit. Bob verifies these attributes are within the limits given in the table above. Bob notes the four feats he picked on the <strong>Powers</strong> page of Bruenor’s sheet. Each of these feats gives a Perk bonus. Bob writes each of these Perk bonuses on the <strong>Perks</strong> section of Bruenor’s sheet. Bob notes the six proficiencies he picked on the <strong>Proficiencies</strong> section of Bruenor’s sheet.</p>

<h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>

<p>Your character’s main ability come from your class, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 20 classes in Forge of Power. See the <a href="/classes.html">Classes</a> page for a full list of all classes and their descriptions. Your character is initially level 0 in each class. For each of your character levels, you gain a level in one class of your choice. This means that your character level is equal to the sum of all your class levels. Your character level and your level in a class determine your tier in the class, as shown in the table below:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Tier</th>
    <th>Character Level</th>
    <th>Class Level</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Novice</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Veteran</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Master</td>
    <td>13</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Epic</td>
    <td>19</td>
    <td>7</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The table above lists the requirements your character must meet in order to reach a tier in a class. For example, to be a Veteran Berserker, you must both have a character level of at least 7 and a Berserker level of at least 3.</p>

<p>Talents are the main abilities your character can use. They define your character’s combat abilities. Each class has a list of talents. Your character knows a number of talents from each class equal to your level in that class. All talents have a tier, which is shown next to the talent’s name. To learn a talent, you must be at least that tier in the talent’s class.</p>

<p>In addition to talents, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are very similar to talents, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities. You learn one ribbon at every odd character level (1, 3, 5, etc.). This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You can’t pick ribbons from a classes that you have no levels in, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.</p>

<p><em>Split your character level between the classes. Write your level in each class on your character sheet. Pick a number of talents from each class equal to your level in that class. Make sure you meet the tier requirements for each talent you pick. Write each talent you chose on your character sheet. Pick a number of ribbons equal to half your character level (rounded up), which can be from any class you have levels in. Write each ribbon you chose on your character sheet.</em></p>

<h3 id="building-bruenor-3">Building Bruenor</h3>

<p>Bob wants Bruenor to be a defensive melee fighter, who hits like a truck and is tough as nails. Since Bruenor is level 3, Bob has three levels to distribute between the character classes. Bob focuses on the Warrior classes, since he doesn’t imagine Bruenor as an expert or a spellcaster. Bob puts 2 levels in Guardian, since Bruenor specializes in defending himself and his allies. Bob puts 1 level in Berserker, since Bruenor is strong and hits hard. Bob writes <em>Guardian 2 / Berserker 1</em> on the <strong>Classes</strong> section of Bruenor’s character sheet.</p>

<p>Bob now needs to pick two talents from Guardian. Bob picks <a href="guardian.html#cover-ally">Cover Ally</a> to help him protect his allies, and <a href="guardian.html#heavy-armor-master">Heavy Armor Master</a> to make Bruenor even tougher. Bob now needs to pick one talent from Berserker. Bob picks <a href="berserker.html#iron-sweep">Iron Sweep</a> to help Bruenor defeat hordes of enemies. Bob writes all three talents on the <strong>Powers</strong> page of Bruenor’s sheet.</p>

<p>Bob also needs to pick two ribbons, which can be from either Guardian or Berserker. Bob picks the <a href="berserker.html#environmental-resilience">Environmental Resilience</a> Berserker ribbon to represent Bruenor’s fortitude, and the <a href="guardian.html#knight">Knight</a> Guardian ribbon to represent Bruenor’s status as a noble warrior. Bob writes both ribbons on the <strong>Powers</strong> page of Bruenor’s sheet.</p>

<p>As your character levels up, they become generally much stronger. At every level, you gain a feat. This feat can be from any of four categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>General Feats</strong> are general abilities that could apply to a broad variety of character classes or skills. General feats can help your character fit into a specific archetype that would otherwise be difficult to achieve.</li>
  <li><strong>Ancestry Feats</strong> are abilities that are specific to your character’s ancestry. These abilities can be either biological or cultural in nature. You can only pick ancestry feats that match your character’s ancestry.</li>
  <li><strong>Combat Feats</strong> help your character fight with specific weapons or magical focuses. Combat feats always give you a Perk bonus.</li>
  <li><strong>Skill Feats</strong> make your character better that using specific skills. Skill feats always give you a Perk bonus.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides gaining new abilities, your character slowly grows numerically stronger as well. At every even level (2, 4, 6, etc.), you gain an attribute boost. Remember that your attributes are limited by your character level.</p>

<p><em>Choose a number of feats equal to your character level, and write them on your character sheet. Choose a number of attribute boosts equal to half your character level (rounded down), and modify your attributes accordingly.</em></p>

<h3 id="building-bruenor-4">Building Bruenor</h3>

<p>Since Bruenor is a level 3 character, Bob needs to pick 3 feats. Bob picks the <a href="feats-combat.html#heavy-bolts">Heavy Bolts</a> crossbow feat in case Bruenor needs to switch to a crossbow for ranged combat. Bob picks the <a href="feats-combat.html#reliable-damage">Reliable Damage</a> bludgeon feat to help Bruenor’s damage against hard-to-hit enemies. Finally, Bob picks the <a href="feats-combat.html#phalanx">Phalanx</a> shield feat to help Bruenor protect his allies even more. Bob notes all three feats on the <strong>Powers</strong> page of Bruenor’s character sheet.</p>

<p>Bob also notes the Perk bonus given by the Heavy Bolts feat on the <strong>Perks</strong> section of Bruenor’s sheet. Bob <strong>doesn’t</strong> add the Perk bonuses of the other feats he just picked: since Bruenor is a level 3 character, he can only stack 1 Perk bonus of the same type. Since Bruenor already has a bludgeon feat and a shield feat that give the same Perk bonuses, these Perk bonuses don’t help out. Once Bruenor reaches level 7, these Perk bonuses will add onto his existing ones.</p>

<p>Since Bruenor is a level 3 character, Bob needs to pick one attribute boost. Bob wants Bruenor to be as strong and tough as possible, but Bruenor’s Strength score is already at the maximum score of +3 for his character level. Bob instead gives Bruenor +1 Intellect, and writes the new stat on Bruenor’s sheet.</p>
